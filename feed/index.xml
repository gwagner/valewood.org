<p>Did you know that <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ChatGPT</a> can help you write <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Ansible">Ansible</a>?  ChatGPT utilizes the same <a href="https://openai.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenAI</a> that <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GitHub Copilot</a> uses to generate code on the fly in your favorite IDE or code editor.  You can ask ChatGPT questions about how to write code, and to the best of its ability, it will send back an answer that is usually pretty good.  This is especially useful when writing automation as part of a team focused on the <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> methodology.</p>



<p>In DevOps you will be hit with many unfamiliar and abstract contexts simply because the space is rapidly evolving and new stuff is being introduced daily.  ChatGPT is trained on information up to 2021, so you will not get anything up the minute, but there are already a lot of problems that have been solved on the internet, but searching for them may be problematic.  </p>



<p>ChatGPT is really good, almost scary, at understanding your request and returning working code examples for you to consume.  Better yet, it is excellent at also providing descriptions about the code it just wrote to help you understand it using natural language.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly side of AI-generated code and how to use chat GPT to write some Ansible!</p>

<h2>The Good: Asking ChatGPT to Create an ESXi Virtual Machine with Ansible</h2>



<p>I posted an article a few months back about the flow that I use to <a href="https://www.valewood.org/ansible-create-vmware-esxi-vm/" data-type="post" data-id="1213">create an ESXi virtual machine</a> using native ansible.  This example comes directly from my home lab setup where I have automated a complete end-to-end <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="4" title="Kubernetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> deployment utilizing Ansible and kubespray.  This bit of code was extracted and abstracted to provide that example on my website.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see if ChatGPT could answer the question:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Using Ansible, how would i create a virtual machine in ESXi?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And here is the response that I got back:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To create a virtual machine in ESXi using Ansible, you would need to use the <code>vmware_guest</code> module. This module allows you to manage virtual machines in VMware vSphere.</p>



<p>Here is an example of how you can use this module to create a new virtual machine:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code language-yaml"><code>- name: Create a new virtual machine
  vmware_guest:
    hostname: "{{ vsphere_hostname }}"
    username: "{{ vsphere_username }}"
    password: "{{ vsphere_password }}"
    datacenter: "{{ datacenter_name }}"
    cluster: "{{ cluster_name }}"
    name: "{{ vm_name }}"
    folders: "{{ folder_name }}"
    template: "{{ template_name }}"
    state: present
    networks:
    - name: "{{ network_name }}"
      ip: "{{ ip_address }}"
      netmask: "{{ netmask }}"
      gateway: "{{ gateway }}"
      domain: "{{ domain_name }}"
</code></pre>



<p>In the above example, we are creating a new virtual machine with the specified <code>name</code> and <code>template</code> on the specified <code>datacenter</code> and <code>cluster</code>. We are also specifying the network settings for the virtual machine, such as the <code>ip</code> address, <code>netmask</code>, and <code>gateway</code>.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is just an example, and you may need to adjust the parameters and settings based on your specific environment and requirements.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is an excellent example of how to perform this task.  If you search google for this exact same search query &#8220;Using Ansible, how would I create a virtual machine in ESXi?&#8221;, the first thing that you get is some obscure ansible documentation that does not really answer the question you were after.  ChatGPT understood exactly what I was looking for and returned a good relevant explanation along with code and a description of variables that you need to define to utilize this code.</p>



<p>Now; ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, or so they claim, so you are unable to ask it for references to relevant documentation, but anyone savvy enough to read this should be able to utilize the provided code to perform a much more detailed search on google to hone in on what they want.</p>



<h3>Extending the Search</h3>



<p>I went back to ChatGPT to ask:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>How would I integrate that utilizing an existing disk image?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, ChatGPT returned the exact same response as it did to my original question.  This is going to be where ChatGPT will fall short.  The example code that I linked above assumes that you have an existing disk image that you are looking to copy and register as a new virtual machine.  ChatGPT, using OpenAI v3, won&#8217;t really be able to contextually understand that use case today, but might in the future!</p>



<h3>How else could I use this?</h3>



<p>I asked ChatGPT this question next:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>How would I do that with GoLang?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Please take note, I have not asked any other questions than what I have put in this thread.  ChatGPT is contextually understanding the conversation that we are having and is deriving its responses based on that context.  This means that it still knows that I am trying to clone out an ESXi virtual machine even though that was 2 messages back.</p>



<p>Here is the response that I got back:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To create an ESXi virtual machine using GoLang, you would need to use the vSphere API provided by VMware. The vSphere API allows you to manage and interact with ESXi hosts and their virtual machines.</p>



<p>Here is an outline of the steps you would need to follow to create an ESXi virtual machine using GoLang:</p>



<ol>
<li>Install and configure the GoLang programming language on your computer.</li>



<li>Use the vSphere API to connect to your ESXi host and authenticate with the host.</li>



<li>Use the vSphere API to create a new virtual machine on the ESXi host. This will involve specifying the hardware configuration for the virtual machine, such as the amount of memory and CPU resources to allocate, as well as the virtual disk size and format.</li>



<li>Use the vSphere API to configure the network settings for the virtual machine, such as the network adapter type and network settings.</li>



<li>Use the vSphere API to install an operating system on the virtual machine. This will involve booting the virtual machine from an ISO image and installing the operating system according to the instructions provided by the operating system vendor.</li>



<li>Use the vSphere API to start the virtual machine and verify that it is running correctly.</li>
</ol>



<p>Overall, creating an ESXi virtual machine using GoLang will require a good understanding of both the GoLang programming language and the vSphere API. It may also require some knowledge of virtualization and ESXi host management.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This response is interesting.  With the Ansible response, code was provided.  With the GoLang response, steps were provided.  This shows a bit of the inconsistency still left to shake out of the system.</p>



<p>I pivoted a bit and asked:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>How would I do this with Code?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And the response looks much better!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote go">
<p>Here is an example of how you might use the vSphere API in GoLang to create a new virtual machine on an ESXi host:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code language-go"><code>import "github.com/vmware/govmomi/vim25/types" // Import the vSphere API package

// Connect to the ESXi host and authenticate
client, err := govmomi.NewClient(ctx, esxiURL, true)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Create a new virtual machine on the ESXi host
vm, err := object.NewVirtualMachine(client.Client, vmConfig)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Configure the virtual machine's hardware settings
err = vm.WaitForIP(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Install an operating system on the virtual machine
err = vm.Create(ctx, pool, spec)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Start the virtual machine and verify that it is running
err = vm.PowerOn(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
</code></pre>



<p>This is just an example of how you might use the vSphere API in GoLang to create an ESXi virtual machine. There may be other ways to accomplish this task using the vSphere API, and your specific implementation may vary depending on your specific requirements and use case. I recommend consulting the vSphere API documentation and GoLang documentation for more information and guidance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pretty impressive that you can get 2 different results for the same tasks in different programming languages all provided by the same AI language model.  Now this response is extremely basic and I would not run it in production anywhere without a lot more inspection and real error handling, but it is perfect to get someone going in a space they are unfamiliar with!</p>

<h2>The Bad: Asking ChatGPT to Write Some Ansible</h2>



<p>Things here get a little bit messier. I have an article <a href="https://www.valewood.org/ansible-text-to-json/" data-type="post" data-id="1187">here</a> to help people understand how to convert a text file to JSON using ansible.  This post was inspired by someone asking the exact same question over on Reddit, and rather than answering it there, I figured it was a good opportunity to write something a bit more long-form that was easier to find that an obscure Reddit thread.  </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see if ChatGPT could answer this relatively simple question on doing the exact same conversion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Using Ansible, how would i convert a text file to JSON and write it to a new file?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And here is the response that I got back:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To convert a text file to JSON using Ansible, you can use the <code>json_query</code> filter to extract the desired data from the text file and then use the <code>to_json</code> filter to convert it to JSON format. You can then use the <code>file</code> module to write the JSON data to a new file.</p>



<p>Here is an example playbook that shows how this can be done:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code language-yaml"><code>---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Read the text file
      delegate_to: localhost
      slurp:
        src: "path/to/text/file"
      register: text_file

    - name: Convert the text file to JSON
      delegate_to: localhost
      set_fact:
        json_data: "{{ text_file.content | json_query(query) | to_json }}"

    - name: Write the JSON data to a new file
      delegate_to: localhost
      file:
        path: "path/to/new/file.json"
        mode: "0644"
        state: "touch"
        content: "{{ json_data }}"
</code></pre>



<p>In this example, the <code>json_query</code> filter is used to extract the desired data from the text file using the <code>query</code> variable. You can use any valid JSON query to extract the data you need. The extracted data is then converted to JSON format using the <code>to_json</code> filter and saved in a variable called <code>json_data</code>.</p>



<p>Finally, the <code>file</code> module is used to create a new file called <code>file.json</code> and write the JSON data to it. You can customize the path, permissions, and other attributes of the file as needed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pretty neat!  Breaking this down a bit, ChatGPT first provides a text-based description of what it is going to do.  The problem is, <code>query</code> is currently not a defined variable meaning that this code is not actually going to run.  </p>



<p>Structurally, this code looks awesome and looks fully functional, but in the end, is not a good representation of a working Ansible that will actually produce the result you are looking for.  If you are looking for a more correct example, please follow the link that I provided above.</p>

</p>



<h2>The Ugly: The Evolving Landscape</h2>



<p>Right now ChatGPT is a bit slow to respond and is very popular meaning that it is overloaded frequently.  There is also no guarantee that ChatGPT will remain free and open forever.  It is currently pulling from a dataset that is powering a paid product called <a href="https://www.github.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="6" title="Github" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> CoPilot meaning that OpenAI has the incentive to lock this functionality down in the future.  </p>



<p>While working on this piece, I had to put things down and come back the next day to finish up.  I decided to run a few questions against ChatGPT again to see what kind of response I would get.  The reality is, they had changed.  ChatGPT engineers are constantly doing training tweaks to the AI to better respond to requests, meaning you will get different responses each time you use it.</p>



<p>I think that this is a very fun toy while it lasts, but I would not consider wrapping this into any kind of mission-critical environment just yet.  But, if you are an aspiring engineer that is having trouble sourcing any kind of kickstart material, or you are just curious, ride this train while the ride is free!</p>

<h2>Understanding Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff</h2>



<p>Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff is an error that occurs when an application running in a Kubernetes cluster fails to start or restart successfully. The issue you are having is right in the name; your application is crashing in a loop and Kubernetes is using a backoff algorithm so that it doesn&#8217;t try to restart your failing app at lightspeed.</p>



<p>CrashLoopBackoff is an algorithmic protection mechanism for Kubernetes clusters. A backoff loop usually happens due to an issue with the application itself, or underlying infrastructure. When this error occurs, Kubernetes will try to restart the application several times, and if it fails all of those attempts, it will log the &#8216;CrashLoopBackoff&#8217; error.</p>



<p>At its core, Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff is simply a way for Kubernetes to notify you that something is wrong with an application in your cluster. It is not necessarily an indication of a problem with Kubernetes itself, so it is important to understand what is causing the issue in order to properly troubleshoot and solve it.</p>



<h2>What Causes Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff?</h2>



<p>Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff can be caused by a number of different issues, ranging from application issues to underlying infrastructure issues. The most common causes of Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Application issues such as bugs, memory leaks, or incompatible configurations.</li>



<li>Infrastructure issues such as insufficient resources, networking issues, or misconfigured storage.</li>



<li>Failing dependencies can cause a backoff loop to happen as well. If your app requires a database, but the database server is down the app may fail rapidly and Kubernetes will report a CrashLoopBackoff error.</li>



<li>An incorrect or missing API key or authentication credentials.</li>



<li>Issues with the Kubernetes API server or the Kubernetes control plane.</li>
</ul>



<p>It is important to understand what is causing the CrashLoopBackoff in order to properly troubleshoot and solve the issue.</p>



<h2>How to Troubleshoot Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff</h2>



<p>When it comes to troubleshooting Kubernetes CrashLoopBackoff, the first step is to identify what is causing the issue.</p>



<p>To do this, you should start by looking at the logs for the application. The logs should provide insight into what is causing the CrashLoopBackoff, such as an application bug or a misconfigured resource. Once you have identified the cause of the issue, you can begin troubleshooting the problem.</p>



<p>Next, check if the application has been configured correctly, if the resource allocations are sufficient, and if the application is running in the correct environment. You should also check for any networking or storage issues that could be causing the CrashLoopBackoff.</p>



<p>Here is a list of checks to work through when diagnosing CrashLoopBackoff errors:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>App logs: </strong>When experiencing a CrashLoopBackoff, there are a few things you can look for in the application logs that may help you troubleshoot the issue. First, you can check for any error messages that may indicate what is causing the CrashLoopBackoff. This could be anything from a syntax error in your code to an issue with a specific dependency or resource that your application is trying to access. These resources could be services such as databases or API endpoints where access may not be properly configured.</li>



<li><strong>Kubernetes Events: </strong>When experiencing a CrashLoopBackoff scenario in Kubernetes, there are a few events that you should evaluate to help troubleshoot the issue. First, you should check the events for your pod to see if there are any error messages that indicate what is causing the CrashLoopBackoff. This could be anything from a syntax error in your code to an issue with a specific dependency or resource that your application is trying to access. Additionally, you should check the events for the kubelet on the node where your pod is running to see if there are any messages related to the CrashLoopBackoff itself, such as a message indicating that the kubelet is restarting your pod due to the CrashLoopBackoff condition. Finally, you should check the events for the Kubernetes control plane components, such as the API server and the scheduler, to see if there are any messages that could provide insight into the cause of the CrashLoopBackoff.</li>



<li><strong>Run the command &#8220;kubectl describe pod -n &lt;namespace> &lt;pod name>&#8221;</strong>: <code>kubectl describe pod</code> provides detailed information about a specific Kubernetes pod. This information includes the pod&#8217;s name, namespace, and status, as well as the node on which it is running and the containers that are included in the pod. Additionally, <code>kubectl describe pod</code> provides metadata about the pod, such as labels and annotations, and it also displays any events that have been associated with the pod. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with your Kubernetes clusters, as it provides a detailed view of the pod and its components.</li>



<li><strong>Enable pod debugging:</strong> This may not be applicable everywhere, but if the application supports debugging environment variables then you should enable this to get more logs from the pod itself. This may show what is causing the CrashLoopBackoff errors to occur.</li>



<li><strong>Investigate pod replicas: </strong>If you have multiple replicas, you may have a running replica pod that you can investigate to compare with your pod that is in a CrashLoopBackoff state. In my experience, if there is at least one running replica, then you would be looking for something more environmental such as improperly configured PVCs, networking, resource allocation, etc.</li>



<li><strong>kube-dns:</strong> To troubleshoot issues with kube-dns in Kubernetes, you can use the <code>kubectl</code> command-line tool to check the status of the kube-dns service and its associated components. First, you can use the <code>kubectl get pods</code> command to see if the kube-dns pods are running and to check their status. If the pods are not running, you can use the <code>kubectl describe pod</code> command to get more information about the issue and to see if there are any error messages that can help you diagnose the problem. Additionally, you can use the <code>kubectl logs</code> command to view the logs for the kube-dns pods and look for any error messages that may provide insight into the issue.</li>



<li><strong>Environment variables: </strong>When investigating CrashLoopBackoff errors, environment variable misconfiguration is a quick and easy place to validate. Ensure that all of the correct environment variables are set for your application. Check the case (uppercase and lowercase) of the variable names if your application is case-sensitive. Check that secrets are mapped properly to env vars if you are mapping secrets.</li>



<li><strong>Secrets:</strong> Keeping secrets safe in Kubernetes is very important. Out of the box, secrets are base64 encoded strings which is not very secure. There are a lot of great mechanisms out there to provide better security. Most of these will require definitions around access to secrets to ensure only resources with delegated access can decrypt and utilize them. Check the documentation for the provider you are using to ensure things delegation are configured correctly.</li>



<li><strong>Ports:</strong> If you are experiencing CrashLoopBackoff errors and suspect that the issue may be related to your port configuration, there are a few steps you can take to diagnose the problem. First, you can check the logs for your application to see if there are any messages that indicate a problem with the port configuration. For example, if your application is unable to bind to the specified port, you may see an error message in the logs indicating this issue. Additionally, you can use the <code>netstat</code> command to view a list of the currently open ports on your system and see if the port that your application is trying to use is already in use by another process. If the port is already in use, you will need to either configure your application to use a different port or stop the other process that is using the port in order to resolve the issue.</li>



<li><strong>Health Probes:</strong> If you are experiencing CrashLoopBackoff errors and suspect that the issue may be related to health probes, there are a few steps you can take to diagnose the problem. First, you can check the logs for your application to see if there are any messages that indicate a problem with the health probes. For example, if your application is failing the health probe because it is unable to connect to a required dependency, you may see an error message in the logs indicating this issue. Additionally, you can use the <code>kubectl</code> command-line tool to view the status of the health probes for your application. For example, you can use the <code>kubectl</code> describe pod command to see the results of the health probes for your pod, and you can use the <code>kubectl</code> describe deployment command to see the overall health of your deployment. This information can help you determine whether the health probes are failing and why, which can provide insight into the root cause of the CrashLoopBackoff errors.</li>



<li><strong>Readiness Probes:</strong> If you are experiencing CrashLoopBackoff errors and suspect that the issue may be related to readiness probes, there are a few steps you can take to diagnose the problem. First, you can check the logs for your application to see if there are any messages that indicate a problem with the readiness probes. For example, if your application is failing the readiness probe because it is unable to connect to a required dependency, you may see an error message in the logs indicating this issue. Additionally, you can use the <code>kubectl</code> command-line tool to view the status of the readiness probes for your application. For example, you can use the <code>kubectl</code> describe pod command to see the results of the readiness probes for your pod, and you can use the <code>kubectl</code> describe deployment command to see the overall readiness of your deployment. This information can help you determine whether the readiness probes are failing and why, which can provide insight into the root cause of the CrashLoopBackoff errors.</li>



<li><strong>Node Health: </strong>To check the health of a Kubernetes worker node, you can use the kubectl command-line tool to view the status of the node and its associated components.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The interview was interesting.  Obviously, ChatGPT is not a sentient being with its own original thoughts so I am not entirely surprised that the answers that were provided were holistically academic in nature.</p>



<p>The most interesting point is the fact that most of the freely available information about the DevOps methodology and its implementation in an organization is entirely academic in nature.  It is aspirational content that speaks to a better way of delivering technology but really lacks many real tactics for getting there.</p>



<p>This blog is looking to solve that.</p>

<h2>What is the Kubernetes &#8220;Pod Stuck Terminating&#8221; Issue?</h2>



<p>The Kubernetes pod stuck terminating issue occurs when a pod remains in the “Terminating” state for an extended period of time. This can be caused by a number of different issues and can be quite frustrating for developers.</p>



<p>The issue can manifest itself in a number of ways. For example, you may see that your pod is stuck in the “Terminating” state and never fully terminates and continues to consume resources. You may check the host to which the pod was assigned, and the <a href="https://www.docker.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="16" title="Docker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Docker</a> container and underlying PID have been terminated, but Kubernetes is reporting it as stuck in a terminating state.</p>



<p>Regardless of the issue, the Kubernetes pod stuck terminating issue can be a major headache for developers and can cause serious delays in deploying applications.</p>



<h2>Common Causes of Pods Becoming Stuck</h2>



<p>The Kubernetes pod stuck terminating issue can be caused by a number of different issues. The most common causes include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Not enough resources:</strong> Kubernetes pods require sufficient resources in order to function properly. If there aren’t enough resources available, the pod may get stuck in the “Terminating” state. It is important to look at the state of your worker node at the time the pod went unresponsive. If all system resources were consumed, like a disk filling up, then Kubernetes may not actually be the core issue to diagnose.</li>



<li><strong>Contention for resources:</strong> If there are multiple pods competing for resources, one of the pods may get stuck in the “Terminating” state as it waits for resources to become available.</li>



<li><strong>Problems with the pod: </strong>If there is something wrong with the pod itself, it may get stuck in the “Terminating” state. This could be due to an issue with the code, configuration, or other problems.</li>



<li><strong>Issues with the Kubernetes cluster:</strong> If there is something wrong with the Kubernetes cluster itself, it may cause the pod to get stuck in the “Terminating” state. This can happen when cluster communications become disconnected from a blip or network partition. The worker node may be functioning as expected, but cannot tell the Kubernetes API that it is working properly.</li>
</ul>



<h2>How to Diagnose a Stuck Pod</h2>



<p>If you find that your Kubernetes pod is stuck in the “Terminating” state, there are a few steps you can take to diagnose the issue.</p>



<p>The first thing you should do is check the logs. Check the logs for the pod to see if there are any error messages or warnings that could indicate the cause of the issue.</p>



<p>Next, you should check the resource utilization of the pod. If the pod is consuming too many resources, it could be causing issues.</p>



<p>After that, you should check the resource utilization on the server at the time the pod became stuck in a terminating state. If the server ran out of disk, the pod became stuck, but now system resources look fine; the reality is that the processes on the server itself may be in an unknown or unrecoverable state without a reboot.</p>



<p>Finally, you should check the status of the node from kubectl. If the node is not reporting itself as healthy via `kubectl get nodes` then that node should be drained, which may not be possible, and subsequently rebooted and its health re-reviewed.</p>

<h2>Strategies for Solving the Issue</h2>



<p>Once you’ve identified the cause of the issue, there are a few strategies you can use to solve the issue.</p>



<h3>Check the Worker Node</h3>



<p>First, check the worker node that was running the pod to see what state the underlying container is in via <code>ctr</code>. If the container is no longer running, the next thing to check is for running PIDs on the system that matches the process being run by the container. If there are no relevant PIDs, then you can run <code>kubectl delete pod --force=true --grace-period=0 -n &lt;NAMESPACE&gt; &lt;STUCK POD NAME&gt;</code> to forcibly remove the pod from the Kubernetes API.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2139.png" alt="ℹ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Depending on your version of Kubernetes, you may have Docker or Container.io as a container runtime.  If you have docker, use <code>docker ps</code> to check container status.  If you have Container.io you will use <code>runc</code> or <code>ctr</code> to check the status of your pods.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this scenario, a pod was successfully terminated on the worker system, but the Kubernetes worker or the API is out of sync with each other and neither of them really knows the state of the pod.</p>



<p>Signs may point to the issue being fixed after this, but in my experience, you should go ahead and do a full health check of your cluster as this is an edge case caused by some underlying issue somewhere else.</p>



<h3>Keep Checking the Worker Node</h3>



<p>I am cheating here slightly. This is an extension of &#8220;Check the Worker Node&#8221;, but we will assume that the pod is actually still running and has not terminated.</p>



<p>When a pod is stuck in a terminating state this way, the PID that the pod was managing may not be terminating properly. Checking logs here should be the first step. I have run into issues in the past where applications are not properly listening to system signals like SIGHUP to know it is time to terminate.</p>



<p>If you are running internally developed software, check with your development teams to see how the application responds to system signals.</p>



<h3>Rolling Reboots</h3>



<p>The worker node may be perfectly healthy in some instances. Working backward, there could be a problem with either the Kubernetes API receiving update information from worker nodes, a network partition / other network issues, or the ETCd cluster may not be synchronizing properly across all nodes and refusing new write operations.</p>



<p>If you are in a highly resilient state in your Kubernetes cluster, load-balanced masters with multiple ETCd nodes, then a rolling reboot should not hurt anything. Your rolling reboot at that layer should be properly communicated to any parties that could be impacted.</p>



<p>In my experience, this may fix a multitude of issues that may not even be presenting themselves. This is why communication is important. There may be resources that are suddenly rebooted or changed in a way that your business partners were not expecting.</p>



<h2>A Step-By-Step Guide to Solving the Issue</h2>



<p>If you find that your Kubernetes pod is stuck in the “Terminating” state, here’s a step-by-step guide to solving the issue:</p>



<ol>
<li>Check the worker node for signs of stuck PIDs or stuck containers through `ctr`</li>
</ol>



<p>If the node has stuck PIDs or a stuck container, the process running inside of the container is not properly listening to system signals like SIGHUP. File a bug report with the application developers for guidance or bug fixes.</p>



<ol>
<li>Check the worker kubelet process logs for signs errors</li>



<li>Check the master&#8217;s kubelet process logs for signs of errors</li>



<li>Check the master&#8217;s kube-scheduler process logs for signs of errors</li>



<li>Check the master&#8217;s kube-controller-manager process logs for signs of errors</li>



<li>Check the master&#8217;s kube-apiserver process logs for signs of errors</li>
</ol>



<p>If any of these checks present an issue, it is time to start rolling reboots of nodes in your cluster. Start with the impacted worker and move your way back to the masters. Other workers in the cluster probably do not need a reboot.</p>



<ol>
<li>Check server resources at the time the pod became stuck in a terminating state.</li>
</ol>



<p>If this is the case, look for both a root cause of why the server filled up, and perform a reboot on the server. Servers become very unhappy when resources like disks become inaccessible due to capacity issues.</p>

<h2>Introduction to DevOps Shift-Left Testing</h2>



<p>DevOps shift-left testing is the practice of shifting testing activities to the left in the software development process. It involves testing at each stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) instead of waiting until the end. This shift-left approach enables teams to catch and address any issues much earlier in the process, saving time and money.</p>



<p>To give some context on the difference between shifting testing to the left and a more traditional testing process, think about a Waterfall project flow. In the waterfall, delivery steps are completed and moved down the assembly line to the next station to get validated or integrated. If there is an issue, it can bring the entire assembly line to a halt.</p>



<p>By moving testing activities earlier in the development cycle, aka shifting left on a delivery timeline, your quality engineering staff are proactively defining the conditions for success through automation. This turns the tables around where quality issues are discovered and remediated causing fewer impacting blockages in your pipelines.</p>



<p>By moving testing activities to the left, teams can find and fix bugs and other issues before they become costly and time-consuming problems. This is crucial for any organization that wants to succeed in the ever-changing world of technology. With DevOps shift-left testing, organizations can reduce the time and cost associated with testing, speed up the development process, and improve the overall quality of their products.</p>



<h2>What is Shift-Left Testing?</h2>



<p>Shift-left testing is the practice of testing earlier in the software development process and shifting activities to the left on a product delivery timeline. It involves testing at each stage of the SDLC, rather than waiting until the end. This shift-left approach enables teams to catch and address any issues much earlier in the process, saving time and money.</p>



<p>Organizations that do proactive planning and discovery on requirements, architecture, and design should also be conceptualizing their quality controls early and often.</p>



<p>Through years of continuous improvement, auto manufacturers have made huge strides to integrate test automation into every stage of their delivery processes. They have done this to reduce their time to market and increase their overall quality.</p>



<p>Shift-left testing helps technology organizations reduce the time and cost associated with testing, speed up the development process, and improve the overall quality of their products. It also allows teams to gain better visibility into their development process, identify potential issues before they become costly problems, and ensure that the quality of their product meets customer expectations.</p>



<p>Shifting Left with testing is also a core tenant of practicing Agile DevOps. Complex systems become easier to manage over the long term when automated testing is integrated early in the development lifecycle.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve implemented shift-left testing, it&#8217;s important to monitor and analyze the results. Here are some tips for monitoring and analyzing shift-left testing:</p>



<ol>
<li>Track progress. Track the progress of shift-left testing to identify any issues that need to be addressed.</li>



<li>Analyze results. Analyze the results of shift-left testing to determine if it is effective and efficient.</li>



<li>Make adjustments. Make adjustments to the plan as needed to ensure that shift-left testing is effective and efficient.</li>



<li>Measure success. Ensure that you have a way to measure the success of shift-left testing so that you can make adjustments if needed.</li>



<li>Communicate with stakeholders. Make sure that all stakeholders are kept informed of any changes or issues related to shift-left testing.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Shift-left testing is a powerful practice that can help organizations accelerate the development process and reduce costs. By shifting testing activities to the left, teams can catch and address any issues much earlier in the process, saving time and money. However, shift-left testing is not without its challenges. Organizations must shift their mindset, allocate more resources to testing activities, and ensure that all teams involved in the development process are collaborating effectively.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to make the move to shift-left testing, there are several steps you can take to ensure success. You should align your goals, develop a plan, train your teams, monitor progress, and adjust as needed. You should also prioritize testing activities, automate whenever possible, and measure success. Finally, you should monitor and analyze the results of shift-left testing to determine if it is effective and efficient.</p>



<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking to accelerate the development process and reduce costs, shift-left testing is the way to go. With shift-left testing, you can reduce the time and cost associated with testing, speed up the development process, and improve the overall quality of your products. So, what are you waiting for? Take the plunge and make the move to shift-left testing today!</p>

<p>They can also be intertwined and confusing leading to misconceptions if one isn&#8217;t careful in their adoption journey. Let&#8217;s dive in and discuss the most common misconception about DevOps and Agile!</p>

<h2>What Are the Most Common Misconceptions About Agile and DevOps?</h2>



<p>There are several common misconceptions that surface quickly when businesses are evaluating DevOps and Agile either independently or together. It is not entirely unreasonable to assume that anyone in the software development space could quickly make the jump from hearing about how awesome DevOps and Agile are into these misconceptions.</p>



<p>Below are a few of those misconceptions.</p>



<h3>Common Misconception #1</h3>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-border-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="border-color:#abb7c266;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px;background-color:#abb7c20d;font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p>DevOps and Agile can fill gaps in my poorly running delivery process</p></blockquote></figure>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>DevOps and Agile are commonly viewed as a tool to fill a gap in software development delivery activities. If delivery cycles are variable in length, inconsistent, and filled with twists and turns; companies will look for some quick outs to patch up their delivery to ship something.</p>



<p>The problem with this approach is low&nbsp;<a href="https://valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/devops-culture-of-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>quality</strong></a>.</p>



<p>While borrowing from DevOps and Agile might work in the short term, it does not work over the long term. Companies or projects looking to step up their delivery processes need to look at things holistically and make some choices about how they want to engage in the market with their customers.</p>



<h3>Common Misconception #2</h3>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-border-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="border-color:#abb7c266;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px;background-color:#abb7c20d;font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p>DevOps and/or Agile can be purchased off the shelf and implemented</p></blockquote></figure>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>DevOps and/or Agile cannot be purchased. There is no singular toolset, workbook, or process that can be purchased and put in place to shortcut the adoption of these methodologies. Both of these methodologies are a fundamental transformation of delivery and need to be adopted fully in order to be effective.</p>



<p>This transformation is also cross-cutting throughout all technical and non-technical roles. A sales team cannot assume that groups delivering technology are delivering in a different way than they are selling.</p>



<p>Account management cannot build plans with customers on their future technology state and expect that planning to look different than the overall delivery workflows. Technology groups cannot adopt a different way of delivering if it is at odds with business expectations.</p>

     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h3>Common Misconception #3</h3>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-border-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="border-color:#abb7c266;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px;background-color:#abb7c20d;font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p>DevOps can be implemented without Agile</p></blockquote></figure>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Now, that statement is a little clickbaity. You can indeed implement DevOps inside of other project management frameworks.</p>



<p>I would make the argument that you cannot fully realize the benefits of delivery transformation unless you adopt both DevOps and Agile. DevOps practices do not lend themselves well to Waterfall, but it can be done. You really lose out on all of the continuous improvement facets of DevOps which really means you are adopting some automation and calling it “DevOps”.</p>



<h3>Common Misconception #4</h3>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-border-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="border-color:#abb7c266;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px;background-color:#abb7c20d;font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p>When DevOps and Agile are combined, you can foregoe planning</p></blockquote></figure>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Software development always needs a great deal of planning. DevOps and agile do not let you get away without planning.</p>



<p>Agile in this case is formal agile delivery which I would argue consists of more planning, market research, feedback, and pivots than any other project management framework.</p>



<p>DevOps focuses on continuous improvement and automation which need a significant amount of planning to ensure the right areas of focus are being worked on.</p>



<p>The truth is this; development teams, operations teams, infrastructure teams, quality assurance teams, account management teams, and members of any other team benefit from having a good plan that is backed up by principles, culture, and a centralized philosophy.</p>

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h3>Common Misconception #5</h3>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-border-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="border-color:#abb7c266;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px;background-color:#abb7c20d;font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p>DevOps and Agile are only for small teams</p></blockquote></figure>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Teams of all sizes can benefit from these delivery methodologies. Software delivery is a complex problem that requires good communication, tools, talent, and principles to drive consistency and quality.</p>



<p>While there are an infinite number of methods that could be used to deliver technology, Agile and DevOps are formalized and prescriptive platforms to solve these complex challenges.</p>



<p>By adopting DevOps and Agile together and bringing a core set of delivery principles to an organization&#8217;s approach to delivering technology, one can actually achieve a much larger scale of delivery more quickly.</p>



<p>All of your teams are on the same page, utilizing the same tools, communicating about the same processes, and driving agile development and operations together as a unified front.</p>



<h3>Common Misconception #6</h3>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-border-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="border-color:#abb7c266;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px;background-color:#abb7c20d;font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p>DevOps and Agile are focused on controlling software development</p></blockquote></figure>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>I would argue that this is the farthest idea from the truth. DevOps and Agile aim to democratize the delivery process across an organization&#8217;s many different value streams.</p>



<p>One of the core principles of the Scaled Agile Framework for Enterprises is to get decision-making as close to the work being performed as possible. This means that teams must work together on their high-level planning initiatives to get stories in the hands of implementers leaving them the freedom to deliver those stories any way they want to.</p>



<p>This does not mean that the business does not have a say in what is getting delivered, but how it is delivered is determined by the individuals that know best.</p>



<p>Early on in the adoption of these methodologies, it is not uncommon for a pendulum of decisions making to swing back and forth between IT and the business as everyone tries to figure out this new dynamic. Everyone&#8217;s goal should be to find a new center where everyone is heard and all concerns, no matter their size, are given room to breathe in a conversation about delivery.</p>

<h2>How Should I View DevOps and Agile?</h2>



<p>By fully adopting Agile and DevOps, a lot of doors are opened up for delivery.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/devops-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flow</a>:</strong> Instead of moving from task to task, or project to project, work can be put onto a conveyor belt of delivery. Agile and DevOps offer more of an assembly line-type flow to technology delivery.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/devops-culture-of-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quality</a>:</strong> Context switching impacts quality. By offering more stability in work coming down the pipeline, engineers in various disciplines can focus on quality first.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/flexibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flexibility</a>:</strong> Companies need to meet the market where it is at. Sometimes this means quickly pivoting from products that are not working to products that do well in the market.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.valewood.org/devops-cycle-time/"><strong>Release faster and work smarter</strong>:</a> By reducing the size and scope of deliverables, the team can focus on shipping more often.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.valewood.org/why-are-ci-cd-pipelines-part-of-devops/">Simplifies Software Development and Operations Focus</a></strong>: Day-to-day operations can seem like a burden that interrupts delivery frequently. By adopting DevOps, operations are a normal part of everyday life.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.valewood.org/devops-trust/">Responsibility</a>:</strong> Agile helps individual contributors feel like they are part of something bigger by influencing the overall planning and delivery processes. They are not just taking orders from the tower, they are actively delivering value against their vision of great outcomes.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consistency</a>:</strong> Consistency brings predictability and reliability to products and planning</li>



<li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Promote data-driven decision-making into your day-to-day workflows through predictability and consistency in the flow of work.</li>



<li><strong>Security:</strong> Security is no longer a secondary burdensome process that detracts from delivering work to the market. Security is built right into DevOps through automated delivery pipelines.</li>
</ul>



<p>Any of these benefits could be achieved on their own in their own ways. By fully embracing Agile and DevOps, each of these ideals comes with the methodology. There is no need to solve an already-solved problem.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>When first hearing about DevOps and Agile, it is easy to build some initial blinders and misconceptions about what they really mean when utilized as a symbiotic relationship.  It takes a mindset change, and a full perspective shift to realize the benefits of DevOps and Agile together.  </p>



<p>I would encourage anyone out there to go get some training, watch some YouTube videos, and read as much as you can about the methodologies and what they have to offer.  DevOps and Agile together can really open up a lot of new benefits for your business and your customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="4" title="Kubernetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>, while fairly mature as a platform, is still considered an emerging technology in the business space.  Due to this, lots of engineers are spending their free time trying to learn about Helm which can lead to some pretty frustrating errors.  </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s discuss why you might be receiving <code>Error: Kubernetes cluster unreachable</code> when trying to connect to your cluster for the first time.</p>



<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</p>



<h2>Kubernetes Install</h2>



<p>There are a lot of different mechanisms on the market today to get Kubernetes up and running depending on your environment.  How you installed Kubernetes is important for troubleshooting later.  Review the install methods and make sure you align underneath one of them in some fashion.</p>



<h3>Local Environment</h3>



<p>Local Kubernetes is going to use <a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">k3s</a> or <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minikube</a> to run and install a local version on a standard workstation.  This is a great way to get familiar with Kubernetes because these products will download and install all the requisite dependencies to bootstrap anyone regardless of their skill level.</p>



<h3>On-Prem Environment</h3>



<p>I am differentiating local and on-prem simply from the viewpoint of servers vs desktops.  In a more server-focused environment, many people will use <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubespray</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kops</a> to deploy their Kubernetes clusters.  Kubespray will ensure that servers are properly configured through IaC while downloading and installing baseline Kubernetes.  By the time you are done, a fully functional cluster should be available.</p>



<p>Kubespray does come with a lot more knobs and dials since it makes fewer opinionated decisions about what your cluster setup should look like.  In a local environment, ingress is going to be handled in a very specific way.  In an on-prem environment, you may have network appliances that want to handle ingress in a very specific way.  Kubespray should be able to get most of your configurations taken care of for your special circumstances.</p>



<h3>Cloud Environment</h3>



<p>Cloud environments can be configured the same way on-prem environments are through kubespray and kops.  Cloud-based VM instances would be spun up on management networks and tools would be run against them to achieve a functioning cluster.</p>



<p>Most cloud providers will have their own managed Kubernetes to be used as well.  Those are probably a much safer way to get started when just starting to dabble in the Kubernetes space.  </p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon EKS</a></li>



<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure AKS</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DigitalOcean</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.vultr.com/kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vultr</a></li>
</ul>



<p>These solutions generally are only a few clicks away from a full-stack deployment.  Once you get a bit more comfortable, it would be a good idea to toss out your test cluster and start to move into Terraform, CloudFormation, or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="20" title="Azure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Azure</a> Resource Manager automation to ensure your clusters are codified for future upgrades.</p>



<h2>Error: Kubernetes cluster unreachable</h2>



<p>There are going to be a few troubleshooting steps you should take to diagnose this issue.  Each of them is going to be a little bit different depending on your deployment setup.</p>



<h3>Check Your Kubeconfig</h3>



<p>The first thing to check is your <code>$HOME/.kube/config</code> file.  This file contains all of the relevant information for connecting to your Kubernetes cluster.  It is also very important you keep this file safe and secret since it holds credentials for that connection as well.</p>



<h4>My Kubeconfig is Missing!</h4>



<p>If your kubeconfig file is missing, review your Kubernetes installation instructions for anything specific about copying a kubeconfig to the proper folder on your local machine.  The instructions may also walk you through how to create one.  Helm will not work without this file being created and in the proper location.</p>



<h4>My Kubeconfig Exists!</h4>



<p>If you open that file to read it, you will find that it is YAML formatted with connection parameters in it.  These parameters should include some certificate information, which are credentials and cluster identification verification, and a hostname for the cluster management API address.</p>



<p>If you have kubectl installed on the same machine as your kubeconfig, a simple test would be to run <code>kubectl get nodes</code> to see if you get a list of servers back from the kubernetes API.  If you get an error, then either you do not have the right level of access, or your kubeconfig is not properly configured.  See above <strong>&#8220;My Kubeconfig is Missing&#8221;</strong>.</p>



<p>If this works as intended, and you see a list of servers the next step is to ensure that your kubeconfig is on the same computer that you would like to run helm from.  If you are running helm from a local workstation, make sure you have a proper kubeconfig on that workstation.  If you are running helm from a different server, ensure a kubeconfig is provided for that server.  Make sure to re-test.</p>



<h4>Check Networking</h4>



<p>Helm communicates with the Kubernetes API over port 6443.  Using NMap to check ports, ensure that the machine you are intending to run helm from has clear line of sight communication with the Kubernetes cluster over port 6443.  This can be achieved on Linux via this command: nmap –p 6443 {{cluster address/master hostname}}.  You can find the cluster address/master hostname inside of a validated kubeconfig.</p>



<p>If you are using Windows and looking for an example of how to do port scans, I would suggest switching to Linux or Mac.</p>



<p>If ports show closed or filtered, network communication will not be established with the cluster and Helm will not be able to run configurations.</p>

<h2>Linux Troubleshooting</h2>



<p>This is an interesting tool that people can use to test out their Linux troubleshooting skills in a capture-the-flag-style event.</p>



<p>Here is what the developer has to say about their SadServers:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is a collection of scenarios, a description of what&#8217;s wrong, and a test to check if the issue has been solved. Servers are spun up on the spot, users get an &#8220;SSH&#8221; shell via a browser window to an ephemeral server (destroyed after the allotted time for solving the challenge) and then they can try and solve the problem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Check it out with the link below if you are looking to up your server administration game!</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/fduran/sadservers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/fduran/sadservers</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p></p>



<h2>DevOps and Software Engineering Job Board</h2>



<p>This is a job board that is centralizing DevOps and Software Engineering jobs on a single board.  I am a big fan of boards like this because they are more targeted and promote more realistic expectations for jobs you might be looking for.</p>



<p><a href="https://software-engineer-jobs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://software-engineer-jobs.com/</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p></p>



<h2>Golang Network Bus</h2>



<p>An event bus is a core component in a microservices-based architecture.  Application A (in control of Domain A) will register an event on the event bus every time a data change needs to be synchronized by downstream systems.  Application B (which needs to reference data from Domain A) will then be able to store its own local copy of Domain A&#8217;s data to reduce dependencies on an external system.</p>



<p>I love seeing projects like this get introduced into the ecosystem.  Many times, we are relying on highly scaleable systems with a massive amount of configurable knobs and dials to achieve relatively simple tasks.  Tools like this are a great way to get your feet wet and dive into a new architecture without all of the extensive overhead of enterprise tools.</p>

<h2>Searchable Asset Directory</h2>



<p>Resmo bills itself as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Complete visibility and security for modern teams</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Centralized asset inventory management is a huge deal in DevOps.  By scanning your assets, you can understand what is out of compliance and subsequently investigate where errors may be happening in automation to allow for that noncompliance.  Without this kind of visibility, changes will go unchecked which makes quality suffer.</p>



<p>Another nice feature of a CAIM product like this is; they are a great Single Point of Truth system.  I have utilized these in the past as an API-driven data repository to feed other downstream automation systems with data they need to accomplish their tasks.</p>

<h2>Kustomize</h2>



<p>Kustomize is a great way to keep your configuration files declarative and free of messy variables and if statements.  Configure your application how you would like and then provide specific override files for different environments.

<p><a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> is a culture and methodology that an organization can prescribe to aid in velocity, consistency, stability, and <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/devops-flow/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="28" title="Understanding the DevOps Process Flow in 2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow of value</a> to the market.  Often confused with &#8220;automation&#8221; being the only benefit of DevOps, the core principles behind DevOps offer a common set of ideals that a team can align under and strive to achieve.</p>



<p>Big A Agile is a project management methodology that pairs well with DevOps to aid in rationalizing work delivery against a set of guardrails.  Agile also provides prescriptive visibility to work being performed ensuring engineers are not being overloaded by overwhelming business priorities.</p>



<p>With those descriptions out of the way, what term best describes both Agile and DevOps?</p>



<h2>Consistency</h2>



<p>The goal of any organization going through change is to drive consistency in delivery.  Without consistency, a technology group cannot adapt to change and a business cannot meet the market where it is at.  </p>



<p>By driving consistency, a business gets predictability which is powerful when scoping and planning new work.  By understanding real velocity, not aspirational velocity, a business can invest in its people and products to grow at a more sustainable rate.</p>



<p>By driving consistency, technologists get the predictability that they need to make sound and rational decisions about how to approach work.  When working against an unpredictable cycle, technology groups will quickly get overwhelmed by the rate of change and produce solutions that do not meet the demands of the market.</p>

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h2>Why Consistency Matters and How it Influences Velocity</h2>



<p>Consistency is important for a couple of factors.  First, individual contributors like their jobs and are not really interested in consistent interruptions or unplanned requests.  While some people may look at those facets as an everyday part of doing business, they can be avoided if mitigation steps are put in place.</p>



<p>When people are constantly interrupted quality suffers.  There is no way around that.  Technology is complex and people need time to focus and go through their problem-solving routines.</p>



<p>Second, inconsistency in delivery has impacts on customers and their delivery.  In technology, you are generally not just working on your system.  There are consumers of your systems who have expectations of either utilization or integration.  By being inconsistent in delivery, you cannot manage the expectations of your consumers.</p>



<p>Lastly, a lack of consistency means that you will never really understand your velocity.  Velocity is important because it tells you how much of X you can get by spending Y.  Think about it like auto manufacturing, they could turn the manufacturing dials up to 11 in their facilities but then you will end up with cars with 3 wheels or loose nuts and bolts.</p>



<p>A trap that we fall into frequently is confusing aspirational velocity with real velocity.  Aspirational velocity is the speed that someone thinks something should get delivered.  Real velocity is a measurement of what can be delivered at a given speed.</p>



<h3>Real Velocity vs Aspirational Velocity</h3>



<p>Aspirational velocity is when a leader says &#8220;We need this product to launch by X date!&#8221;.  We have either all been in that position or will be in that position sometime in our careers.</p>



<p>Without proper support, investment, and foresight in planning; aspirational velocity will almost always end with sub-standard products that greatly increase the future cost to the business.  Leaning harder on anyone in the delivery space always leads to decisions that are short-sighted toward a narrow goal.</p>



<p>I believe aspirational velocity is firmly rooted in the idea of needing to &#8220;take a shot&#8221;.  Checks are constantly being written that others are expected to cash.  Sometimes this works out and I would say can be necessary for a startup or green field project.  Any organization looking to grow over time should be looking for its tipping point when aspirational velocity needs to transition into real velocity to offer a more reliable work environment for their employees.</p>



<p>Real velocity is based on the idea that you are going to make hard choices about which work is important to feed into a model where delivery is consistent.  When more work needs to be done than can be achieved by the current velocity, hard choices will be made to cut work, increase staff, defer work, or invest in current technology to increase velocity.  </p>



<p>Any business should have a firm goal of understanding its real velocity and do everything in its power to tamp down or extinguish aspirational velocity.</p>



<h2>DevOps and Agile are Closely Related</h2>



<p>I have another article that describes how DevOps and Agile are related to each other.  Primarily, Agile is about lean work being performed against targets and goals with frequent demos of the work being completed to influence pivots.  Agile was in need of a technology delivery methodology that could help realize the fundamental mission of Agile. </p>

</p>



<h2>Runners Up</h2>



<p>This question is also asked on a few official exams.  I want to make sure that my perspective on DevOps does not overshadow exams that do not have as much wiggle room in their answers.</p>



<h3>Brainly.in</h3>



<p><a href="https://brainly.in/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://brainly.in/question/36271184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainly</a> answers the question like this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Agile is refers to an interative approuch which focuses on collaboration, costumer feedback,and small rapid releases,DevOps is considered a practice bringing development and operations teams together.</p>
<cite>https://brainly.in/question/36271184</cite></blockquote>



<p>The problem is, I don&#8217;t think this answer refers to a specific term.  We can look at this and assume that they are looking at Agile and DevOps as two holistically different approaches which are getting merged together instead of looking for commonality between the project management methodology and the technology delivery methodology.</p>



<p>While this may sound really good on a test, there are real business influences that come from each of the facets that they list in their answer.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Greater collaboration brings more of a hive-mind approach to problem-solving.  Too much collaboration on very large problems can bring analysis paralysis.  By breaking problems down into tiny and lean releases, everyone can stay more focused on achieving goals instead of trying to eat an entire elephant all at once.</li>



<li><strong>Customer Feedback</strong>: Agile focused on getting valuable work products out to the market quickly to reduce investment risk.  Getting feedback from customers is a great way to manage risk and pivot quickly if needed. </li>



<li><strong>Small Rapid Releases</strong>: To further the idea of managing risk, lessening the size of your releases helps you containerize risk into much smaller units.  If something isn&#8217;t working as expected, or the market shifts drastically, it is far less painful to throw that work out and pivot to something more palatable.  Additionally, the risk is lowered on incremental improvements to new features for existing functionality since the introduced change should not pose as great of an impact on an already healthy ecosystem.  This is something <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> could learn a thing or two about.</li>



<li><strong>Bringing DevOps and Operations Teams Together</strong>: This is the typical textbook definition of DevOps.  The reality is, DevOps and Agile are about breaking down silos and creating fully cross-functional teams who are able to fully deliver work in a highly efficient and lean way.  DevOps and Agile help drive decision-making down as close to the work being performed as possible while offering up a management framework to transparently keep other interested parties informed while work is being completed and shipped.</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see, there are a lot of nuances packed into each one of those bullet points.</p>



<h3>Intellipaat.com </h3>



<p><a href="https://intellipaat.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://intellipaat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intellipatt</a> answers the question like this</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A set of values and principles. Because both follow a set of principles and offer the value that is similar.</p>
<cite>https://intellipaat.com/community/74027/which-term-accurately-describes-agile-and-devops</cite></blockquote>



<p>I believe that this answer is a primarily business-focused answer looking to understand the idea of value in the market.  While it is not an incorrect way to look at things, I do not believe it is the most important way to look at DevOps and Agile.  </p>



<p>Value is a byproduct of DevOps and Agile.  The real benefit to DevOps and Agile is the consistent way that said value gets delivered to the market.  This means that you can calculate and quantify value through data-driven decision-making.  You are also able to manage market expectations and take potentially larger leaps to satisfy your customers.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The key to any technology product&#8217;s success is consistency.  DevOps and Agile offer consistency while remaining flexible and focused on common non-functional requirements like reliability and stability.  Other facets of Agile and DevOps like value are byproducts of a team or teams of teams who fully embrace the complementary delivery methodologies.</p>

It&#8217;s no longer just an isolated set of tools and processes which promise an automated future, it’s an entire culture that’s infiltrating every facet of software development.</p>



<p>This post will try to explain why the DevOps methodology itself is not boring.  We will also try to explain why a feeling of boredom stems from properly implemented tools and processes. We also dive into how you can make DevOps more exciting while keeping your sanity intact.</p>

<h2>What Does DevOps Mean?</h2>



<p>The term DevOps, or “development operations,” first appeared in the tech world in the early 2000s. It was a term used to describe a certain type of organization that was responsible for the entire application and software development lifecycle, from ideation to production.</p>



<p>Teams would be responsible for both the development and operations workflows, providing a more efficient way of working. As DevOps has grown in popularity, it has expanded beyond just operations teams.</p>



<p>Now, people are interested in speeding up their software development process using the term DevOps to describe the combined usage of infrastructure automation tools and best practices for team collaboration and communication.</p>



<p>There are two main components within DevOps that drive the culture. They are infrastructure as code and automated delivery. IaC is really just a way of organizing your code and infrastructure so that it is easily reproducible and shareable. Automated delivery is a method for automatically deploying applications and configurations without human intervention.</p>



<p>With the increase in automation, engineers may find themselves wondering when the next exciting change event may present itself. They may also wonder if they are automating themselves out of a job.</p>



<p>As a basis for understanding DevOps, you must understand that this practice exists to remove the excitement of a chaotic technology delivery process. DevOps is meant to be boring by nature.</p>



<p>As a side effect of DevOps being stable and consistent, organizations must look for other ways to keep their software engineers and DevOps engineers engaged through other means of excitement.</p>



<h2>Why is DevOps Boring?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Why DevOps is Boring in 2022" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bP5nWWFV2gg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>As companies begin implementing modern DevOps practices, some people may notice a lull in excitement. The tools, processes, and overall culture of DevOps may feel exciting at first but quickly turn into monotony. Why?</p>



<p>DevOps becomes boring because people approach it as a checklist. They focus on the tools and processes and completely ignore the culture and mindset that lies behind the methodology.</p>



<p>These people don’t understand why they are implementing certain tools or why they are following specific processes. They are just doing it because they read an article that said their company should be adopting DevOps, or they read a book that talked about the “predictable <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/devops-flow/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="28" title="Understanding the DevOps Process Flow in 2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow of value</a>”.</p>



<p>What makes DevOps exciting is the culture behind it. The practices and tools are just the means of achieving a certain culture. If you try to implement DevOps but don’t adopt the correct mindset and culture behind it, then you are going to end up with a boring and ineffective implementation.</p>



<h3>Fewer Natural Learning and Growth Opportunities</h3>



<p>A stable DevOps lifecycle will inherently bring a lower number of emerging technologies and opportunities to integrate emerging technologies. Sure, early on in DevOps adoption, the emerging tech will be all the rage, but that will subside as stability and consistency are driven into the pipeline.</p>



<p>Since continuous improvement is a fundamental principle of DevOps, teams should be encouraged to do some data-driven analysis looking for opportunities to become more efficient in their delivery cycles.</p>



<p>Pivots can also be made within the team. Someone who is primarily focused on ops should be put in a position to both share what they are doing and also be presented with opportunities to look at other fields like coding or security. This is true for all specialties that make up a function DevOps team.</p>



<h3>Comfort in Previous Success</h3>



<p>All too often, I see companies in the industry falling back on the comfort of their successes as an excuse to not rapidly evolve. DevOps should be putting companies in a position where pivots are much easier to pull off. Secondarily keeping a DNA of being lean and nimble should be a focus of any company.</p>



<p>Any company sitting back on its heels thinking it can keep doing what they are doing forever is going to be consumed by its competitors operating at a different level. Break that cycle by listening to the opportunities being presented by your DevOps Engineers and your Software Engineers to keep DevOps from becoming boring and your company from stagnating.</p>



<h3>Never Being Complete or Finished</h3>



<p>When completing a project, a person can get a huge dopamine rush along with a personal sense of accomplishment. DevOps doesn’t really offer that in large quantities. Work is much more methodical, incremental, and bite-sized meaning a team’s ability to celebrate a big win is less frequent.</p>



<p>If you want to truly adopt a culture of continuous improvement, you need to make sure that your team is constantly learning and improving their knowledge. This means your team should be continually looking for new books, podcasts, and ways that they can expand their skill set, improve their knowledge, and learn new things.</p>



<p>When DevOps is paired with Agile, those opportunities are even more spread apart. Everyone on the team is incrementally feeding their work into a larger integrated system. Resources may be assigned to a larger initiative for only a short period of time before being rolled off to another set of work.</p>



<h3>DevOps Engineers are a Figment of your Imagination</h3>



<p>A DevOps Engineer does not exist. They are not real. Yetis are more real than DevOps Engineers are.</p>



<p>DevOps is a methodology and a culture that does not require a role engineer it. There are many engineering practices that compose a full team practicing DevOps. Confusion about what someone is really intended to be working on will leave those individuals to fend for themselves and miss out on a healthy team dynamic.</p>



<p>When culture is suffering in a team practicing DevOps it can become boring or worse extremely frustrating. There is not a shared vision or goal that team is trying to achieve. This means that the work being performed is being done in isolation and under-appreciated. Let’s face it, we are not doing our jobs for our own health, we do them to contribute to something bigger than ourselves.</p>



<h3>The Hype Train</h3>



<p>I see a lot of posts on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> which have individuals from different disciplines looking to make the jump from their current career path over to DevOps. Most of what I read leads me to believe that they are being sold a bill of goods which just isn’t reality.</p>



<p>While I do believe that problem-solving in a space fully embracing DevOps is more complex than in any more traditional space, I do not believe that most companies are embracing DevOps fully. This means that job applicants are applying for and landing DevOps positions that are not actually meeting the spirit of DevOps. Organizations are generally looking for a little bit of help automating some manual processes but stop short of full adoption.</p>



<p>This will lead engineers to be as bored at this new shiny DevOps role as they were in their former system administration role.</p>



<h3>Running out of People to Blame</h3>



<p>Office politics can be entertaining to some. In a fully functioning DevOps culture, everything is treated as code, tested in code, operations happen in code, and releases are automated all of which remove a lot of formal human interaction in the daily development and release cycle.</p>



<p>Game of Thrones was not popular because Joffrey methodically picked apart Rob Stark and his armies. GoT was popular because of the drama, suspense, twists, and turns. Now, the office should not be a Game of Thrones style drama, but; DevOps is very good at transitioning from a culture full of interpersonal conflict into a blameless culture focused purely on technology which can be boring.</p>

<h2>What Are Some Examples of Engineers Boredom Executing DevOps?</h2>



<p>Below are some examples of different roles and how they can become bored with their job when DevOps is being practically utilized for its processes but not viewed as a persistent growth opportunity.</p>



<h3>Debbie Developer has a Case of the Mondays</h3>



<p>Debbie became a software engineer because of her love for puzzles. Solving complex scenarios and producing elegant maintainable code is her passion.</p>



<p>Early on in the DevOps adoption process, she was jazzed that there was a whole host of new problems to solve when transforming a traditional set of build jobs into something that could support CI/CD.</p>



<p>As time has progressed, she is feeling less fulfilled in her day-to-day job. The kinds of work she is performing have become far less complex and much smaller. There is almost no coordination between members of her team since she can just push code at will and let automation take over to push it into production.</p>



<p>It is the same daily slog over and over and over again.</p>



<h3>Simon the Systems Administrator is Running Out of Work To Do</h3>



<p>Servers create themselves. Simon doesn&#8217;t need to log into the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="14" title="AWS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS</a> console anymore to check anything because the platform is completely self-service.</p>



<p>When adopting DevOps, systems administrators will often find themselves developing a lot of code around system configurations. This works well because in their specific domain, they want consistency and operational efficiency.</p>



<p>Over time, Simon&#8217;s work has been extremely helpful in level-setting expectations around solid delivery patterns. But what is next for Simon? There does not appear to be any new or related systems on the horizon for Simon to continue to grow his skills. Growth has stagnated and there really isn&#8217;t a path forward for Simon to earn a senior systems administrator position.</p>



<h3>Quintin Feels Like Their Role as a Quality Assurance Engineer is Monotonous</h3>



<p>Developers are writing their own unit, functional, and integration acceptance tests. Quintin is left building some visual testing to be added to the delivery pipeline.</p>



<p>Quality assurance engineers are the glue that holds a development community together. They are well-versed in requirements and testing and they are constantly working with their developer counterparts to ensure their work will be accepted by customers.</p>



<p>DevOps can take away this sense of community in the development process. Individuals are responsible for contributing their own tests while they write code. As tests are passed, the code moves its way into production.</p>



<p>DevOps has effectively worked Quintin out of a job.</p>



<h3>Connie the Cloud Engineer is Struggling to Provide Value</h3>



<p>DevOps pipelines will consist of application code, test automation, system automation, and infrastructure automation (cloud or on-prem). Once developed, engineers will shift focus to day 2 operations. Once day 2 operations are tackled, what&#8217;s left?</p>



<p>Connie felt value and excitement in the early days of DevOps, but is now isolated away from the rest of the team because systems have been stabilized, security is second nature, and AWS is effectively running itself.</p>

<h2>5 Tips to Make DevOps Exciting Again!</h2>



<p>We’ve covered why DevOps can become tedious, but what can you do about it? If you want to make DevOps exciting again, then you have to understand why it is exciting in the first place!</p>



<p>The reason DevOps is exciting for most companies is because of the focus on drastically improving your software development process. It’s a way of improving communication, collaboration, and the overall quality of your software. It’s a way of adopting a culture of automation.</p>



<p>Automation is important in DevOps because it directly impacts the speed of your software release cycles. It can also help improve the overall quality of your software as well as your organization.</p>



<p>Automation is a core component of DevOps. When you make automation a core part of your development process, you are able to reduce the number of repetitive tasks your organization has to perform. This means you can put less focus on manual tasks, and more focus on things that actually improve your software and the company as a whole.</p>



<h3>Provide Growth Opportunities</h3>



<p>Some companies confuse growth with “opportunities to become a manager”. Most of the really good engineers and architects that I have met will “manage” a project because they want to see it succeed not because they want to be a manager.</p>



<p>Providing opportunities for growth in knowledge, automation, systems, development, operations, platforms, consulting, or any other area that your services or products may not be fully taking advantage of today.</p>



<p>As an example, if you have an awesome set of pipelines that obfuscate some of the complexities of doing automated delivery, challenge your team to package that up and white-label it. Have them use those packages to consult with other teams in your organization to level their automation skills up.</p>



<h3>Inject Failures</h3>



<p>We are always focused on delivering key projects, functionality, or needs of the business. With a narrow view of the world being delivered first, that does not leave a lot of room to poke at the softer edges of your products.</p>



<p>Introduce automated failure models like a chaos monkey. Start with planned times and have your chaos monkey start to take down some low criticality services and review the characteristics of what that means. There may be impacts in areas that you were not expecting.</p>



<p>This provides an opportunity to add some advanced troubleshooting to an area that the DevOps methodology took away through its inherent consistency and stability.</p>



<h3>Incorporate User Feedback Into DevOps Processes</h3>



<p>User feedback is important to any business because it allows you to understand your customers and discover ways to improve your product. However, user feedback is hard to come by because customers don’t usually interact with businesses on a consistent basis.</p>



<p>In order to incorporate user feedback into your software development lifecycle, you need to be able to get consistent feedback from customers. There are two main ways to do this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Use survey tools to let customers provide feedback on your product, team, and company.</li>



<li>Let customers interact with your team using live chat tools.</li>
</ul>



<p>Both of these tools are easy to implement and can help you get useful and consistent feedback from customers. Feedback is also a great way to breathe some excitement into an otherwise stagnant work environment.</p>



<h3>Be Realistic with Expectations</h3>



<p>As I stated above, DevOps Engineers are not real. Business leaders need to come to grips with this fact and be very realistic with expectations around roles and work assignments. If you are looking to shortcut full DevOps adoption by hiring some DevOps engineers as a gap fill, you will not be able to provide an exciting environment that keeps your technology groups engaged.</p>



<h3>Celebrate Completion</h3>



<p>Get your teams together to do some good old-fashioned team building. Wins are wins no matter how big or small they are. Recognize your team’s accomplishments because they deserve to be recognized.</p>



<p>The methodical pace of DevOps and Agile do not lend themselves to recognizing big wins or the sheer volume of work that it really takes to get to those wins. Team leads should focus on bringing their teams back to the center by recapping how much success they have had knowing their work is never done.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>DevOps is not boring. It is an exciting change in the way that organizations approach software development. However, it is only exciting if you fully commit to the culture of DevOps and all the benefits it has to offer.</p>



<p>If you just implement the tools and processes without the culture and mindset, then you are only doing half the work and missing out on the benefits of the fully implemented DevOps culture.</p>



<p>If you want to make DevOps exciting again, you must ensure that you are fully committed to the culture. Only then will you be able to make the most of everything that DevOps has to offer.</p>
