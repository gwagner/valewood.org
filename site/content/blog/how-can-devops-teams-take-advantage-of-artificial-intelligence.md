Artificial intelligence is everywhere in technology these days. If you are building software that captures data, odds are that you are also training ai models to enhance that data. AI tools have mostly been kept at arm's length from the DevOps space until recently.

While your company is developing products for consumers out in the market, every company should be looking for ways to enhance that cycle to get their products and service to market more quickly. Augmenting your software development process, enhancing software testing, and removing complexity from complex tasks should be your primary focus if speed is your goal.

Giving DevOps engineers access to AI tools to augment their workflows is a great way to continue to enhance your product's stability, reliability, and availability. AI tools can assist DevOps teams to focus on rapidly accelerating their delivery objectives without sacrificing quality.

Let's dive into a few areas where AI systems can help achieve these goals to enhance your business model.

## Automation

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to automate a range of jobs in the DevOps cycle, such as recognizing and solving issues in the production environment, implementing updates and patches, and monitoring the health of systems.

For instance, AI can be taught to detect patterns in log files or error messages, and quickly detect and fix issues as they come up through automated remediation. This can boost the efficiency and dependability of production systems and ease the workload of DevOps teams.

Moreover, AI can be employed to automate the testing and deployment of code changes, allowing teams to release updates faster and with fewer mistakes. This can be done through continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which build, test, and deploy code changes as soon as they are added to version control.

By utilizing AI in this way, the DevOps team can concentrate on more significant tasks, instead of expending time on manual, recurrent duties.

## Predictive Maintenance

Predictive maintenance is a cutting-edge technique of upkeep that relies on data and analytics to anticipate when devices or infrastructure may possibly fail, and to take preventive measures before the breakdown occurs. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be employed to increase the accuracy and effectiveness of predictive maintenance in the DevOps workflow.

Ongoing maintenance is necessary for any complex environment, but; at the end of the day, unplanned maintenance due to issues will take teams away from delivering value to the market. Predictive maintenance proposed by ai enabled monitoring tools can help in eliminating inefficiencies.

For instance, AI can be used to investigate data from sensors or other monitoring systems to detect patterns or trends that could be indicative of an impending malfunction. By alerting the DevOps team to these prospective issues beforehand, AI can help to avoid outages or disturbances and reduce the demand for unscheduled maintenance.

Plus, AI can be used to modify the upkeep schedule based on the predicted breakdown rates of different equipment, infrastructure, or services. This can assist the DevOps team to prioritize maintenance tasks and allocate resources more effectively.

## Anomaly Detection

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be employed to enhance the precision and accuracy of anomaly detection in production systems. For instance, machine learning can be instructed to recognize trends in data from monitoring systems or log files, and to discover variances from these trends that could demonstrate a concern or problem.

By providing the DevOps team with insight into these anomalies in real-time, AI can help to avert outages or disruptions and lessen the impact of problems on the production environment.

Furthermore, AI can be used to investigate data from numerous sources, such as application logs, system performance metrics, and user feedback, to detect associations and patterns that might not be evident to a human viewer. This can aid the DevOps team to quickly determine the root cause of any issue and take any necessary corrective actions.

## Decision Making

Decision making is a critical aspect of the DevOps workflow, as it involves making informed decisions about how to optimize the workflow and improve efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of decision making in DevOps.

For example, AI can be used to analyze data from various sources, such as application logs, system performance metrics, and user feedback, to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to a human observer. This can help the DevOps team identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about how to optimize their workflow.

In addition, AI can be used to make recommendations to the DevOps team based on this analysis. For example, AI might recommend changes to the infrastructure, deployment processes, or monitoring systems to improve reliability or performance. By leveraging AI in this way, the DevOps team can make more informed and data-driven decisions about how to optimize their workflow.
Continuous Integration and Delivery

Continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) is a method of software engineering where code changes are routinely built, tested, and deployed as they are saved in version control. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to refine the accuracy and productivity of CI/CD in the DevOps workflow.

AI can be used to mechanize the trial process by recognizing and ordering test cases based on the code alterations being deployed, aiding the DevOps group to guarantee that code changes are completely tested prior to going public.

Here are a few of the benefits AI systems can provide DevOps teams:

- **Automating repetitive tasks:** Utilizing AI to understand the overall timings of repetitive tasks and, with the advent of technologies such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, propose more performant solutions to those problems can help speed up your pipelines.
- **Integrating Natural Language Processing:** Depending on your environment, copywriters may be sending over new content to be added to your technology stacks. By integrating NLP into your CI/CD pipelines, grammatical errors can be detected before software is shipped.
- **Automated testing:** While teams should still remain accountable for writing their own tests for their software, more quality issues can be discovered by enabling AI systems to perform exploratory testing on your systems as well.
- **Code Quality:** AI has gotten really good at reading and understanding code. As previously mentioned GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are great tools for this. By adding some AI-enabled testing tools you can let AI manage complex tasks like code smells or code optimization.

Moreover, AI can be used to optimize the deployment process by scrutinizing data from previous deployments and making suggestions about the most effective way to deploy code changes. For instance, AI could suggest deploying code changes in small amounts, or in a precise sequence, to reduce the risk of disruption.
