<p>DevOps is all about bringing software development and operations together under a single functional team to increase quality, communication, collaboration, and efficiency.&nbsp; Developers already have a background in development (duh), but a question I get asked frequently by operations engineers is “Are there languages to learn for DevOps?”</p>



<p>Everyone could use a little bit of development in their life.&nbsp; It could be something as simple as a bash script to take care of a simple task, all the way up to running a blog like this one.&nbsp; Learning about the logical flow that a computer takes to compute everything is an empowering door to open when growing as a technology specialist in whatever field you specialize in.&nbsp; Below are a few of my favorite DevOps languages but this is by no means a definitive list.&nbsp; These are languages that I have used in my workflows and found some great success.</p>



<p>Let’s discuss some of the languages you can learn as someone with little to no experience so you can level up your DevOps game!</p>


<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</p>



<h2>Interpreted vs Compiled Languages</h2>



<p>The first concept that we should tackle is the difference between an interpreted language vs a compiled language.&nbsp; There are some specific semantics to get under your belt as part of your language selection process.&nbsp; In the world of DevOps, I would say that there really is not an incorrect choice here, but; DevOps is all about flow and your choices here can have an impact on your desired technology flow.</p>



<h3>Interpreted Langauge</h3>



<p>An interpreted language requires that a separate runtime be installed on your system which will generally perform a JIT runtime on the code you have written.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I am writing code in Python, and I want that python to run on a remote Linux system, I need to have both the Python runtime installed on the remote system along with ensuring my code also exists on that system.</p>



<p>There is some practical utility to this.&nbsp; Your systems require a dependency like Python, PHP, Ruby, Bash, etc. to be installed on the remote system, but you get a pretty good guarantee that you can write code once and use it in many places across many architectures.&nbsp; The architecture (x86, ARM, SPARC, etc) has the runtime binaries installed (Python) and Just In Time “compile” (interprets) your code to be run on that architecture.&nbsp; Pretty neat right?</p>



<h3>Compiled Languages</h3>



<p>A compiled language requires that a full compilation happens prior to the code being runnable.&nbsp; In Windows land, think about this like a .exe file, or on Linux, this would be a binary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I am writing code in C++, and I want to run by C++ on a remote Linux system, I have 2 options.&nbsp; I can install C++ on the remote system, add my code to that system, run a compile step, and finally run my binary.&nbsp; Alternatively, I could compile my binary locally (ensuring I match the OS and CPU architecture as part of the compile step) and then distribute that binary to the remote system for execution.</p>



<p>Generally, a compiled language will be statically linked which means that there are zero additional dependencies that need to live on a remote system, unlike an interpreted language.&nbsp; You do need to have a more detailed understanding of the remote system you will be deploying to so that your pre-compiled binary has a much better shot of being able to run on the destination.</p>



<h3>Need for Speed?</h3>



<p>Compiled languages are generally going to be faster than interpreted languages.&nbsp; A compiled application or script does not need to get converted from human-readable text into a binary that the CPU will understand.&nbsp; That compilation was done when the application was built.&nbsp; An interpreted language is going to need some kind of JIT compilation in order to be executed through the language&#8217;s runtime.&nbsp; In the PHP world, this JIT compilation is transforming human-readable text into OpCode.&nbsp; Once that OpCode is created then the PHP runtime can just execute what the OpCode tells it to execute.</p>



<p>When trying to do tool selection, there is generally an argument about the speed an application runs and whether the right tool is the fastest tool.&nbsp; When doing DevOps where you are generally trying to get a machine or environment into a specific state, the speed of the language itself is generally not your biggest impediment.&nbsp; Your biggest bottleneck will be remote resources like packages, downloads, etc.&nbsp; I would rather choose the right tool for the job inside of the ecosystem that I work in instead of trying to make my tool selection for DevOps based solely on performance.</p>



<h2>Python</h2>



<p>Python is an interpreted language and was created in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands.&nbsp; It is widely adopted and widely used across the industry.&nbsp; You can find Python pre-installed on most modern Linux distributions today, though there is still a bit of fracturing between Python 2.x and 3.x communities.</p>



<h3>Community</h3>



<p>Python has a strong community backing it.&nbsp; At the time of writing this, PyPI has ~391,000 packages with nearly 660,000,000 package downloads per day.&nbsp; PyPI is a package repository for Python where you can download community or vendor-developed code and add it directly to your project.&nbsp; There are a lot of pre-solved problems out there like connecting to a database.&nbsp; PyPI enables users to download packages like those database connectors automatically.</p>



<h3>Utility</h3>



<p>Python has a lot of utility in the DevOps space.&nbsp; Since it is born out of the Linux and Unix ecosystem, it has some very strong ties to the Linux operating system for performing common tasks.&nbsp; It is so well suited for this task that <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Ansible">Ansible</a>-Core is written in Python.&nbsp; Python is also runnable on Windows!</p>



<p>Python is clearly a good choice when it comes to writing automation code for DevOps, but it has a lot of other utilities as well.&nbsp; Much of the Big-Data space is using python for number crunching and machine learning specifically because the language lends itself well to that kind of computation.&nbsp; Being a dynamically typed language instead of a statically typed one, data transformations can be done quickly without a lot of overhead by the end user.</p>



<p>Being an interpreted language gives it a lot of power as well when it comes to distributing and running the code.&nbsp; Aside from activities like automated testing, packaging Python consists of compressing your directory structure, moving it to where you want, decompressing, and finally running the code.&nbsp; If there is a bug, you can also fix it in place, though I would recommend ensuring that you have centralized code repositories and follow a good process of version control and pushing new versions out.</p>



<h3>Learning Resources</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learnpython.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.learnpython.org/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-csv-file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-csv-file/</a></li></ul>



<h2>Golang</h2>



<p>Golang was originally designed at Google in 2007 as a replacement for C and C++.&nbsp; Go foregoes some of the more tedious facets of C and C++ like header files for type definitions.&nbsp; Go is also a compiled language instead of an interpreted language meaning that the result of something in Golang is going to be a binary.&nbsp; Golant has quickly grown in popularity and is the core language behind the very popular container orchestration framework <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="4" title="Kubernetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>.</p>



<h3>Community</h3>



<p>The size of the Golang community is tough to nail down because of the way that Go mod works.&nbsp; Go mod can be any git URL that has a go.mod and go.sum file in its repository.&nbsp; From there, go mod will check out the code, and check out the code&#8217;s dependencies all while doing dependency resolution in the background.&nbsp; Since git can be hosted anywhere, nailing down how many downloads a day without some kind of body providing central registration of packages like PyPI does, the best we can do is look at something like google trends for a baseline of activity.</p>



<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3045_RC01/embed_loader.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/09gbxjr","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"/m/06ff5","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"/m/05z1_","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F09gbxjr,%2Fm%2F06ff5,%2Fm%2F05z1_&date=today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});
  </script>



<p>As you can see by the graphic above, at the time of writing, Python is the dominant search in Google Trends compared to something like Golang.&nbsp; I would consider Golang a strong and growing community with projects like Kubernetes and CockroachDB along with large technology groups moving into using the stack like <a href="https://www.github.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="6" title="Github" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and Uber.</p>



<h3>Utility</h3>



<p>In my workflow, I am generally using Golang for 2 things; microservice apps and API middleware.</p>



<p>When I say microservice apps, I am generally not talking about something which is composed of a larger ecosystem.&nbsp; My microservice-type apps are usually tied into a Kubernetes stack.&nbsp; I had a particular challenge with <a href="https://linkerd.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="3" title="Linkerd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkerD</a> where I need to create a MutatingAdmissionWebhook to rewrite my HTTP(s) probes as in pod curl probes after setting my namespace to deny all.&nbsp; This was a good workaround to wrapping and rewriting many different helm charts to use curl probes instead of using standard HTTP(s) probes.</p>



<p>You can find that code <a href="https://github.com/gwagner/linkerd-convert-http-to-curl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When doing API orchestration, I have written a few applications which will pull data from one API (or have data pushed via a webhook) into an application that may amend or transform the data before pushing it into another receiving API.&nbsp; This is particularly useful when trying to normalize data from system A to system B.&nbsp; This was particularly useful when moving from a Graphite-based metric TSDB system over to InfluxDB.&nbsp; We did not need to rewrite all of our metric collectors, we just needed to tap into the metric stream, do an on-the-fly conversion, and then output metrics to InfluxDB.</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>



<p>Because of its efficiency in DevOps, Ruby is a preferred scripting language for automating IT environments&#8217; repetitive tasks. In addition to web development, data science, and unit testing, this dynamic, interpreted programming language is used for DevOps. Ruby is also fairly simple to learn. As a result, the language has a fast-growing community of DevOps engineers. With no prior programming experience, beginners can get started with Ruby pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Community</h3>



<p>Ruby is a difficult community to quantify fully simply because of how spread out it is.&nbsp; Ruby Gem can be a good baseline metric with roughly ~174,000 gems available from RubyGems.org and 111B+ (yeah, billion) downloads.&nbsp; If you look past ruby gems, the second most popular place that ruby is being utilized is with <a href="https://www.chef.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="8" title="Chef">Chef</a>.&nbsp; The marketplace has roughly 4,000 cookbooks with roughly ~80,0000 maintainers</p>



<h3>Utility</h3>



<p>Ruby has some great utility when it comes to DevOps automation.&nbsp; When building out an early DevOps-focused monitoring stack, we chose Sensu Core due to its configuration-driven and scalable design.&nbsp; Most of the community-produced checks at that point were written in ruby which lent itself very well to building reusable consistent libraries that were well-tested.</p>



<p>Much like the Golang example above, I have also utilized ruby as an API middleware for doing data payload manipulations.&nbsp; Prior to Docker supporting <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON File Logging</a>, there were very long debates about what separation between log entries means between different programming languages.&nbsp; Ruby was used in an environment where I was working into tail log output from containers and based on its configuration, properly parse and package logs to be sent to centralized logging systems upstream with additional metadata.</p>

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
</p>



<h2>Security Considerations</h2>



<p>When utilizing any code for any function whether it be DevOps or software development, you should always be concerned about security.&nbsp; Let’s say you have a 3-year-old server sitting around and its original automation code has not had any electricity run through it in the same time frame.&nbsp; That server&#8217;s automation code is probably outdated enough that there is at least some kind of CVE attached to it.&nbsp; This will be particularly easy to find if you are doing robust infrastructure scanning but will be much more obscure if you are running compiled binaries where the source code is not under some kind of routine scrutiny.&nbsp; Regardless of how you are building and running code, please make sure to clean up after yourself and avoid getting attacked by leaving a trail of outdated technology behind you.</p>



<h3>Supply Chain Attacks</h3>



<p>Supply chain attacks are all the rage these days.&nbsp; Consider the supply chain of your code dependency management system.&nbsp; Are you routinely scanning it for CVEs?&nbsp; Are you doing any kind of dynamic automated or manual testing of the code looking for vulnerabilities?&nbsp; Are you sure you can trust the source of your code dependencies?</p>



<p>DevOps code can be commonly overlooked in a supply chain attack scenario.&nbsp; Maybe you are writing a console tool to help make your life a little bit easier.&nbsp; You go ahead and pull in a few libraries from the internet to help aid in the creation of that tool like colored output.&nbsp; You also want to be really good and write automated tests as a best practice and you need help generating some data for those tests.&nbsp; Without a persistent review of code dependencies, the OSS developer/contributor of one of the dependencies that you are utilizing is tired of their <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work being used for free without any recognition or compensation</a> and deliberately destroys the project.&nbsp; There are also less directly malicious scenarios where the developer of a <a href="https://blog.sonatype.com/npm-project-used-by-millions-hijacked-in-supply-chain-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular package gets targeted and code is unknowingly slipped into their project</a>.</p>



<p>The lesson is this: assume that attack vectors are everywhere and ensure that you are scanning everything you can get your hands on for CVEs.&nbsp; The industry has a good focus on this now, and the question is not IF you will get compromised, but when.&nbsp; Keep yourself safe by being proactive.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As I stated at the beginning of this article, this is by no means a definitive list.&nbsp; This is a list of some of the tools that I utilized to build effective DevOps workflows and to enable the flow of delivery.&nbsp; I utilize these tools at my job along with utilizing these tools in my homelab.&nbsp; I believe that everyone could use a little bit of software development in their life.&nbsp; Python, Golang, or Ruby are really great places to start with languages because of their utility, communities, and ties to DevOps and DevOps tooling.</p>

<p>The goal of any DevOps tool should be to help your team communicate more effectively, automate manual tasks, and track the progress of your projects. With the right tools, you can significantly speed up your development process and produce better results. In this post, you’ll find a list of the most essential DevOps tools and advice on how to choose the right ones for your team.</p>



<h2><strong>Build Tools</strong></h2>



<p>Build tools are an important cornerstone for any kind of DevOps workflow. Just choosing one without doing an evaluation can mean the difference between success and failure in a lot of circumstances. The build tooling must jive with the team and accomplish producing the CI/CD processes which the team expects in the way they expect them to be run. Think of them as task runners with a GUI, but each task runner has its own flare. Below is a list of tools that are widely used and could fit the bill for your next project.</p>


<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7120242057450442"
     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
</p>



<h3>Jenkins</h3>



<p>If you have spent any time in the software space, or have done any googling around building software, Jenkins is sure to be the first thing that pops up. Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Companies use it to automate the software development process, build and test their code, and deploy their applications. Jenkins is a highly configurable tool that allows you to choose from a large range of plugins. These plugins allow you to integrate Jenkins with other tools such as Docker Hub, JIRA, and others. Jenkins can be used for DevOps to automate the software delivery process, deploy apps, and manage infrastructure.</p>



<h3>Atlassian Bamboo</h3>



<p>Atlassian Bamboo is a platform for building and managing builds and deployments of software. It is generally utilized due to its tie-ins with other Atlassian products such as Jira and Confluence giving you an entire ecosystem out of the box. It is a great option if you are working in a team and want to set up a standardized process for building your code. Bamboo allows you to set up different stages of your workflow, each with its own set of tasks. This way, you can create a dev stage where your team has access to the latest version of the code and works directly from it, a test stage where your team can run tests on the latest version of the code and a production stage to deploy the code once it has been tested. As a rule of thumb, if you are working in a team that is already entrenched in the Atlassian ecosystem, go for Bamboo.</p>



<h3>Drone CI</h3>



<p>Drone bills itself as a &#8220;Self Service Continuous Integration System&#8221;, but I think you can really view any of the tools listed under build as exactly that. If you are looking for the more modern cool kid on the block, Drone CI is probably going to be a pretty good choice. Drone CI is natively built around Docker and the container ecosystem. This makes building modern applications more intuitive for individuals who are accustomed to the container ecosystem already. Drone CI also supports other types of containers, such as rkt. For developers who are not as familiar with Docker, Drone CI does have a user interface that allows you to manually configure a build environment. Drone also has a plug-in architecture, which means that you can also extend Drone’s capabilities with your own plug-ins, allowing you to configure a custom build environment as well.</p>



<h3>Travis CI</h3>



<p>Travis CI is a bit of a unique take amongst its competitors listed above. Travis CI is not a service you would normally go and locally install in your data center. Its origins are built under the idea that building environments should be ephemeral, cheap, easy, and defined via software. Their service allows you to create a new build environment by just pushing code to your <a href="https://www.github.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="6" title="Github" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository. The great thing about this is that it allows you to create any type of environment you want. In the case of Travis CI, they allow you to build your environment in a way that is open source and completely controlled by you.</p>



<h3>GitHub Actions</h3>



<p>GitHub Actions is a new entrant to the build and deploy space, and frankly, the next logical step in GitHub&#8217;s journey of code hosting. GitHub has become the de-facto standard for hosting code, and Actions takes it a step further by allowing you to programmatically trigger a series of actions on your code, such as building, testing, publishing, and deploying it. Actions is a game changer as it allows anyone to create their own automated workflow without the need for any additional software. For example, let’s say you want to deploy your code to your staging environment every time you push a new commit to your master branch. You can now easily set up an action that listens for new commits on the master branch, checks out the code, kicks off a build process, and then deploys the code to your staging environment.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>In this space, I am a fan of the tool that gets the job done. I don&#8217;t have any particular allegiances because build tools are just dumb task runners. Maybe a UI speaks to you more, or a set of tools plugs into an ecosystem more seamlessly than another tool. Either way, do a bit of evaluation and make sure you are not painting yourself into a corner, and you will be just fine with any of these tools. Sign up for free trials, do a bit of exploring, and if you have questions, there is a vibrant community of people who are happy to help! Stay tuned to blog posts, newsletters and social media to stay up to date on new features and helpful tips and tricks!</p>



<h2><strong>Server Configuration Management</strong></h2>



<p>Below, <a href="https://puppet.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="9" title="Puppet">Puppet</a> and <a href="https://www.chef.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="8" title="Chef">Chef</a>, are the two 5000-pound gorillas in the room when it comes to configuration management DevOps tools. Other competitors exist in the space, but I would argue always live on the fringes and are not really taking any market share away from these two primary options any time soon. Some would argue that <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Ansible">Ansible</a> should be in this category as well, but I would argue that Ansible is a task orchestrator and NOT a configuration management tool. Give Ansible tasks, it orchestrates tasks, and when it completes someone will need to write more code to determine if the task was executed correctly. In my eyes, DSCM-level validation of completion is a core feature that a configuration management system should have out of the box, otherwise, it is a task orchestrator masquerading around to be something like a configuration management DevOps tool. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there is still a spot in my heart for Ansible, just not under configuration management.</p>



<h3>Puppet </h3>



<p>Puppet is an open-source tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC). It’s often used for configuration management, service deployment, and continuous delivery. Puppet works by installing agents on different system types and installing the Puppet server on one or more machines. The Puppet server manages the agents to configure the systems based on user-defined policies. It can be used with DevOps to manage configuration policies, provision and configure infrastructure, and automate deployment. When using Puppet myself, I normally do not connect Puppet back to a Puppet master. I run puppet headless so that my idempotent builds can be deployed and triggered at will. This also helps avoid some of the licensing costs of Puppet. As of the writing of this post, their pricing is also hidden behind a contact wall. This generally means: &#8220;If you have to ask, you probably can&#8217;t afford it&#8221;.</p>



<h3>Chef</h3>



<p>Chef is an open-source tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC). It’s often used for configuration management, service deployment, and continuous delivery. Chef works by installing agents on different system types and installing the Chef server on one or more machines. The Chef server manages the agents to configure the systems based on user-defined policies. It can be used with DevOps to manage configuration policies, provision and configure infrastructure, and automate deployment. When using Chef myself, I normally do not connect Chef back to a Chef master. I run puppet headless so that my idempotent builds can be deployed and triggered at will. This also helps avoid some of the licensing costs of Chef.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>As you can see, the descriptions of the tools are nearly identical. The primary difference between these two tools is going to be the community supporting package availability, price, and their specific DSL. Chef is primarily Ruby driven which gives you a TON of flexibility when you need it by diving into the Ruby space. This is an antipattern so use it sparingly, but it can be helpful in a pinch. I would also argue that the Chef community is currently much stronger than the Puppet community having many more packages developed and maintained by the community. In my career, I started with Puppet and converted to Chef simply for that fact.</p>



<h2><strong>Infrastucture Configuration Management</strong></h2>



<p>In this post, I am going to be focusing on AWS and Azure as the primary examples of IaC CM tools. I am explicitly ignoring GCP, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="5" title="DigialOcean" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>, etc. because every cloud vendor has its own APIs, its own tool sets, and its own concepts which are really all born from what AWS and Azure have already pioneered.  If you are interested in the most marketable DevOps tools focusing on infrastructure configuration management, then these are the tools I would focus on first.</p>



<h3>AWS CloudFormation</h3>



<p>AWS CloudFormation is a native toolset provided by AWS which is utilized to configure their cloud platform. It enables you to configure your cloud infrastructure and also create templates for future usage. These templates can be used to create infrastructure as code, which is a best practice in terms of cloud adoption. CloudFormation provides you with a lot of flexibility as compared to other tools, but it is not easy to start with.</p>



<h3>Azure ARM Templates</h3>



<p>Using an ARM template, you can declaratively create and deploy Azure infrastructure, including virtual machines, networks, storage systems, and any other resources you require. The template simply describes what you want to happen, and Azure takes care of the details. You can also use templates to generate code or scripts to create or customize resources. Versioning: You can keep track of changes to your templates by keeping them in source control, just like you would any other code. You can also use templates to generate reports, giving you an easy way to track changes to your infrastructure. Reusability: You can create a library of templates to use in different scenarios.</p>



<h3>Terraform</h3>



<p>Terraform is a cross-cloud IaC tool produced by HasiCorp. They take a unique view of IaC where components that span across multiple clouds should be abstracted out for future reuse. Terraform is also a unique tool in that its open source, but has a paid enterprise version with additional features. Terraform is a great fit for enterprise environments where you want to maintain strict version control of your cloud infrastructure, have strict regulatory requirements, or have a dedicated team managing the infrastructure where you want to streamline your process with a tool that can enforce policies across the organization.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t have a right or wrong answer for this space. I do believe that if you have a need to get into the deepest nooks and crannies of a cloud hosting vendor, using native tooling (CloudFormation and ARM Templates) will always beat what Terraform has to offer. If you are looking to be a bit more functional cross-cloud by providing an interface for your organization to consume, Terraform is probably a better option.</p>



<h2><strong>Monitoring and Observability</strong></h2>



<p>I believe that there is no right answer to monitoring and observability as long as the answer doesn&#8217;t work for the team that needs to receive the alerts. If you are using a 24&#215;7 on-call system like OpsGenie, and your technologists refuse to install the application on their devices to get notified, it is probably the wrong way to go about ensuring someone is alerted to issues. The tools listed below range from out-of-the-box to highly customizable tools. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. If you are going to go with highly customizable and integrate that directly into your pipelines, then the team must be on board with the idea of additional maintenance in code space rather than the GUI space, and vice-versa for the out-of-the-box tools. As long as you and your team agree on the strong fundamentals of &#8220;99.9% of the time, get an alert that something is wrong before someone else notices and reports it&#8221;, then you at least have a good foundation to start selecting monitoring from.</p>



<h3>LogicMonitor</h3>



<p>From physical hardware to software applications, to virtual hosts, to network devices, to cloud infrastructure — LogicMonitor monitors it all. LogicMonitor is able to monitor virtual environments with its application monitoring capabilities. It can also monitor physical environments with its physical monitoring capabilities. With LogicMonitor’s comprehensive monitoring capabilities, it’s no wonder that it’s the monitoring software of choice for thousands of organizations worldwide.</p>



<h3>Sensu </h3>



<p>It works with any monitoring tool, like Graphite, Collectd, Elastic, and more. It can also receive data from other loggers, like statsd, in real-time. Sensu Go can collect data from virtually any source, maintain it in a data store for analysis, and send it to any output, including email, mobile push notifications, or synchronous or asynchronous webhooks. It is open source, flexible, and extensible with a wide range of configuration options.</p>



<h3>Prometheus</h3>



<p><a href="https://prometheus.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="2" title="Prometheus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> is a popular open-source monitoring system for metrics, logs, and events. It enables querying, graphing, and alerting on time-series data. It collects metrics from a variety of sources, including systems and applications, and stores the metrics data in a data store. The metrics data is then made available for analysis via a variety of tools. Prometheus has a flexible architecture and can be deployed on-prem or in the cloud. It is highly scalable and can support metrics from any type of application. It is widely used by enterprises to monitor their production systems.</p>



<h2><strong>Task Runners / Orchestration Tools</strong></h2>



<p>I am only putting one tool in this section because I believe that there is only one tool worth talking about. That DevOps tool is Ansible.  Ansible is like a swiss army knife of task orchestration and your ability to hop in and out of specific contexts is unparalleled.</p>



<h3>Ansible</h3>



<p>Ansible is a tool for automating tasks across multiple devices &#8211; from physical hosts to virtual machines and even cloud providers. It allows you to programmatically automate tasks and workflows, and it’s the most widely adopted open-source automation tool in the world. In fact, according to the 2017 State Of Configuration Management Survey, Ansible is the most widely used configuration management tool in enterprises. Unlike other tools, Ansible requires very little upfront investment — you can get started with a free download. Additionally, there are many ways to scale Ansible beyond a single node, including cloud services like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>If you are looking to orchestrate events across multiple machines, services, or clouds; I honestly do not know why you would choose anything else.  I have used ansible to manage 1000+ machines in a data center orchestrating events across servers, services, clouds, and physical equipment all while making the intentions of the orchestration very clear to future engineers.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and operations to shorten the development life cycle and provide continuous delivery and faster time to market. It’s a culture shift that requires collaboration between Development and Operations teams. The tools used in DevOps can be customized to meet the unique needs of your organization. These tools can automate the software delivery process, provision and configure infrastructure, and deploy applications.</p>
