<p>Automation Testing in <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> is generally relegated to the software being released to production. Environmental testing is performed by manual testing practices or high-level smoke tests.</p>



<p><strong>Test automation should cover the full CI/CD pipeline including infrastructure, delivery tools, software, UI, and any other technology that is included in the pipeline. Automated tests should not be relegated to the land of software development.</strong></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore what automation testing in DevOps really means when you are looking to stabilize your delivery process and accelerate your business!</p>

</p>



<h2>Automated Testing in DevOps</h2>



<p>Generally, developers tend toward coding unit tests to validate that the code is running the way they expected. At the same time, quality practitioners create automated user tests that validate the end-to-end user experience.</p>



<p>Quality practitioners can arrange explorative testing sessions in which teams manually look at various application area issues.</p>



<p>DevOps&#8217; best practice for the automation of CI/CD pipelines is to run automatic testing whenever possible. This means deploying automatic test UIs to production to detect and proactively address user experience concerns.</p>



<p>I generally like to take this a step further when looking at environmental conditions. Tests for environments can also be thought about in the context of monitoring and observability. A pipeline should be qualified through the use of testing tools in an automated test process. The tests should also be composed in a way that they are usable as part of your monitoring system.</p>



<p>For example, if you are willing to validate that a certificate is valid as part of your testing framework, you should also be willing to run continuous testing to validate that the certificate does not expire between releases.</p>



<h2>The Importance of Test Automation</h2>



<p>Test automation improves reliability, continuity, and productivity within teams of developers and products. DevOps teams have a better chance of staying within budget without disrupting crucial debugging or problem-shooting processes.</p>



<p>Test automation can be quicker than manual testing. It helps to avoid costly errors by eliminating communication barriers and saves money in teams by eliminating unnecessary work. Testing automation provides new forms of flexibility that enable the development team to reuse test scripts across the testing software.</p>



<p>As a business leader, do not be fooled by the short-term investment cost of introducing automated testing into your environment. Testing automation is not new and sexy functionality that you can provide to the market which is why I believe it is skipped by many businesses. Automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous delivery are critical investments to the longevity of your products.</p>



<p>Each release is always going to end up being more complex than the previous release. Employing a good testing process ensures that your products are being introduced to the market in a reliable and expected way. Because of the increased complexity, any manual testing process will need to scale to meet that complexity. Automated testing does not scale in cost the same way that manual testing does.</p>



<h2>What is test automation?</h2>



<p>Test Automation enables users to automate their software testing to ensure that they meet specified quality standards. Different types of testing are often depicted in pyramids. As you ascend the pyramid, the number of testing types decreases, and the costs of creating and operating the test increase. The most traditional tests were conducted using manual methods in the Pyramids in the past. It was a slow and costly procedure until automated testing tooling came into effect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.headspin.io/blog/the-testing-pyramid-simplified-for-one-and-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/619e15d781b21202de206fb5/6316d9e765cd53d9937e2b6a_The-Testing-Pyramid-Simplified-for-One-and-All.webp" alt="The Testing Pyramid"/></a><figcaption>Headspin: The Testing Pyramid: Simplified for One and All</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Common Test Automation Pitfalls</h2>



<p>Below are some of the most common issues when adding automated testing to your technology products:</p>



<ul><li>Developers not participating in testing</li><li>Unit tests not being written with code</li><li>Testing tools are not being used to their fullest potential</li><li>No standard for code coverage</li><li>Best practices not being employed for a specific technology stack</li><li>Tests are not being run in the proper places of a pipeline.</li></ul>



<h2>How Automated Testing Powers DevOps?</h2>



<p>One of the core goals of DevOps is to improve delivery flow. Test automation is one of the core strategies used to help smooth out both flow and quality expectations. A cultural pillar of DevOps is continuous improvement.</p>



<p>Due to the shortened feedback loop of your continuous delivery pipeline, smaller and more nimble software testing and release cycles can be achieved by the development team. This means that your applications will be less prone to errors due to robust testing.</p>



<p>When issues are discovered in production they are not turned into a grandiose response event. A DevOps team is able to get adjustments made to both code and tests and re-release the software quickly back into production.</p>



<p>Without automating releases and tests, teams will scramble to recertify software before being ready to push it back to production with bug fixes. Worse, if your software teams do not employ any testing, you may never know about critical issues before customers bring them up.</p>



<h2>How Can I Improve Continuous Testing?</h2>



<p>Continuous testing is one of the most important things you can do to improve your success rates. If you’re doing it right, continuous testing will help you catch bugs at the earliest stages of development and make sure that problems don’t creep up in production.</p>



<p>Continuous testing helps to keep projects on track and ensure that they stay on schedule, which means that your customers get their products sooner.</p>



<p>A good way to start building a continuous test strategy is by creating an automated integration test pipeline. It should consist of a series of tests that are run automatically when new code is added to your application.</p>



<p>Automated integration tests can be especially useful when you have a large team developing multiple applications that share common code libraries or frameworks. They can also be useful for large-scale applications with many users and complex data models.</p>



<p>Continuous testing also allows developers to build trust with their customers by letting them know that their products are being continuously tested and improved. This can help to increase customer confidence in your product and boost retention rates.</p>



<h2>How Does Automated Testing Change the Role of Quality Assurance?</h2>



<p>Automated testing is a way to evaluate the quality of software. The basic idea is that you write automated tests, or scripts, to check for unexpected behaviors or errors in the code.</p>



<p>Automated testers can run these scripts automatically, which saves time and effort for both developers and QA staff. When you have automated testing in place, you can focus on other tasks, like exploring new features or fixing bugs, without worrying about whether your application is running correctly.</p>



<p>There are two types of automated testing: static and dynamic. Static testing checks for basic issues like syntax errors, security holes, and database integrity. Dynamic testing checks for unexpected behaviors such as out-of-order execution, race conditions, and timeout issues.</p>



<p>QA teams use automated testing to maintain high standards of quality throughout the development process. They can catch issues early on in the development cycle and communicate findings effectively with developers and stakeholders.</p>



<p>By reducing bugs and improving overall quality, automated testing can help organizations achieve their goals more quickly and cost-effectively.</p>



<p>A Quality Assurance Engineers&#8217; role changes when embracing test automation testing. Their role will now be to enable the entire team to contribute tests to the automation pipeline. Test cases should be developed and run as part of the normal delivery process.</p>



<p>By making this transition, Quality Assurance Engineers can now focus on higher value work like covering edge cases, improving testing tools and methodology, and leveling up team members&#8217; skills in testing.</p>

<h2>Test Automation Stages</h2>



<p>Test Automation includes several fundamental automation techniques that should be followed for quality testing. Testing automation systems are presented in stages atop test pyramids based on their hierarchy.</p>



<h3>Integration testing</h3>



<p>Integration tests measure whether logical integration is effective across all systems and can be achieved without unavoidable errors in integration. Incorporated testing is designed to test compliance with systems to determine how different modules interact.</p>



<h3>Unit testing</h3>



<p>Unit Testing means isolating your Application into unit testing and then checking its behavior independently of external parties or database configuration. Unit tests are often conducted throughout the build period and are considered the primary test phase.</p>



<h3>End-to-end testing</h3>



<p>Test frameworks for the testing of applications simulate user requirements to ensure they meet the needs of users at all levels. The final purpose is to ensure the application can be validated and checked by all the users.</p>



<h3>Exploratory testing</h3>



<p>Exploration testing can be regarded as a more advanced software testing strategy that involves learning, checking, and reviewing functional and visual components for users.</p>



<h3>Environmental Testing</h3>



<p>Building tests to validate the consistency that your software will be running in after deployment.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As you can see, automated testing is a cornerstone to DevOps. Most focus is generally put on running automated testing against software being developed. There are a lot of advantages to developing automated testing which also looks at environmental conditions as well. Accelerate your business by introducing automated testing tools today!</p>

<p>Whether it’s Python, JavaScript, or other programming languages, Developers spend a lot of time writing code. More traditional infrastructure engineers are going to spend their time in a user interface configuring their systems and services to work for their organizations. Operations teams are going to be picking up what was developed for them by other groups and determine the right ways to run it efficiently.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> engineers are going to be performing configuration management efforts, software development, operations activities, and quality assurance activities. Each of these can be automated by writing code with scripting languages. This means that DevOps engineers write code!</strong></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore what this means to a DevOps engineer who may not be comfortable with code since they are coming from a practice that generally performs their activities inside of a user interface.</p>


<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
</p>



<h2>Why Scripting Code is Important</h2>



<p>Automation is important. It’s a key part of the DevOps process, which aims to reduce the time it takes to perform manual processes. Automation also increases the reliability and stability of those processes.</p>



<p>While a lot of people talk about it, they rarely talk about why. If you don’t have a good reason, there’s a good chance that you won’t see the benefits of automation in your organization. That’s why it helps to understand why you are automating in the first place.</p>



<p>DevOps organizations have a lot of tools and technologies that need to integrate together. DevOps engineers will spend almost every day automating these integrations utilizing a variety of scripting languages or DevOps tools.</p>



<p>When you spend your days configuring everything from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="14" title="AWS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AWS</a> keys to the location of a database; it’s easy to understand why organizations want to reduce the amount of time spent doing it manually.</p>



<h2>DevOps and Scripts</h2>



<p>Those who work across multiple different technologies to build applications and services spend a ton of time configuring environments, virtual machines, and cloud providers.</p>



<p>That means developers have to learn how to use every single one of those tools. At first, this might feel like a chore; after all, no one wants to learn how to use Inversion of Control (IoC) or batch files to get something from AWS into their local computer or network.</p>



<p>When you look at it from the perspective of someone who spends most of his or her day typing in code and reading other people’s scripts—the process can seem more like an abomination than anything else.</p>



<p>A majority of engineers are writing scripts to make their jobs more efficient. Scripts are the shortcut version of automation. They’re designed to help engineers reduce the amount of time they spend doing system administration, delivering software to servers, monitoring systems, performing configuration management, managing cloud vendors, and many other activities.</p>



<p>I have always advocated if you perform an activity against a user interface that has an API then you should take the time to implement that activity in code via your scripting language of choice.</p>



<p>By scripting your changes out, you both get an opportunity to codify a change, but you have an opportunity to introduce that code into version control. This will help shift the responsibility of that code from a single person to an entire team.</p>



<p>Additionally, scripting gives you the opportunity to add comments to your code. Software developers utilizing high-level programming languages will add comments in their code so that the next person that picks up their work understands the intentions of their work. Changes through scripting should be treated the same way. When someone spends time writing scripts, those should be added to the collective code base and their peers should be able to understand the code and consume their work.</p>



<p>Contributing to the code base also allows that code to be integrated into CI/CD systems for future automated actions.</p>



<h2>Which DevOps Engineers Should be Working With Scripts?</h2>



<p>The first step in automating any process is figuring out who should do the automation. That can be tricky. It’s easy to think that the developers who spend most of their day writing code should be the ones to automate their work.</p>



<p>After all, they have all of the technical knowledge. But, depending on the organization, that might not be the best idea. In organizations using DevOps practices, developers aren’t soley responsible for creating new end-to-end application solutions.</p>



<p>Instead, everyone on the team is responsible for creating an entire infrastructure along with the entire DevOps lifecycle.</p>



<p>DevOps engineers are responsible for automating the deployment and operations process of software applications. They are responsible for automating everything from creating configuration files to configuring software environments.</p>



<p>Many DevOps engineers work with scripts. There are many reasons why this is the case. One reason is that scripts allow DevOps engineers to automate tasks that are repeatable across multiple environments and application iterations.</p>



<p>If an automated task must be performed multiple times during the development process, it makes sense to create a script that can be used in each environment. Another reason is that scripts help reduce errors by providing clear instructions on how to perform the task.</p>



<p>DevOps engineers should be knowledgeable about scripting languages, such as Bash, Python, Ruby, and Javascript. They should also be familiar with automation tools like <a href="https://www.docker.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="16" title="Docker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Ansible">Ansible</a>.</p>



<p>They should be able to identify areas where automation can improve their workflow and determine what types of changes are needed to make automation possible in their organization.</p>



<h2>Why is it So Hard to Transition from Scripting to Automation?</h2>



<p>It might seem like your engineers would love to transition from scripting to automation. After all, they are spending their day writing code.</p>



<p>Sometimes a jump from scripting to automation can be difficult. If scripts are not written in a way that they can be parameterized, those scripts will not fit into an overall automation structure natively. Additionally, when you’re used to customizing everything from your local machine to your cloud providers, the thought of learning a new configuration tool can seem like a nightmare.</p>



<p>All of this confusion can lead engineers to either choose not to automate at all or make bad choices about how to automate. The software development industry has an answer for this.</p>



<p>Most engineers will take a little bit of time to work through the transition from their previous role into one that is inclusive of DevOps. This is why it is so critical to work with the team on learning DevOps and embracing a full DevOps transition.</p>



<p>Most software development starts as writing scripts, shell scripting, or learning bash. From there, it will expand into utilizing different popular programming languages. If your background is in Office365 administration, you will not go through this general progression.</p>



<p>Developers should take new DevOps engineers under their wing and help them utilize tools that may not be ultimately familiar with. DevOps engineering is the combination of many different skill sets breaking down traditional barriers. Helping DevOps engineers write scripts that are able to be integrated into a larger set of automation will be a huge step forward for anyone feeling lost in this adoption.</p>

<h2>How to Get Started With Automation in a DevOps Organization</h2>



<p>DevOps engineers constantly improve their automation, but there’s a lot to learn. That’s why it’s important to bring on someone to help with the transition to automation.</p>



<p>There are a few things you can do to get started. First, look at your existing scripts and see if you have any that could be automated. Are there any tasks that are taking more time than they should? If so, you might want to take a closer look at them. Next, look at your existing infrastructure. Do you have a known, consistent state? If so, you might want to take a closer look at your scripts.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you’re a DevOps engineer who is coming from a user interface, the idea of writing code that can automate different tasks may seem scary. You may feel overwhelmed by the scope of this responsibility and wonder whether you can actually do it.</p>



<p>To start, you can check out some resources that are available on <a href="https://www.github.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="6" title="Github" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. One of the best ways to get started is to dive right into the world of scripting. The Python programming language is great for beginner developers because it’s very easy to pick up and performs well under the hood. Python has a free online course available that teaches you the basics with a few projects you can complete.</p>



<p>Once you know your way around Python, you can move on to the next step. As you progress, you can check out some of the other scripting languages in use. There are many options out there, and most of them are open-source and available for use. Your best bet is to choose one that you feel comfortable with, and then get familiar with the basics. You can find plenty of tutorials and documentation on how to get started with any of them.</p>



<p>When you feel ready, you can start experimenting with the different ways to configure your systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The first benefit of <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> is that it enables organizations to release software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality. By breaking down the barriers between development and operations, DevOps allows teams to work together more effectively and efficiently. This helps companies get new features and updates into the hands of their customers more quickly.</p>



<p>The second benefit of DevOps is that it helps organizations become more agile. By automating the deployment process, DevOps makes it possible for companies to respond quickly to changes in customer demand or market conditions. This allows businesses to be more competitive and stay ahead of the curve.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at each of these benefits in detail!</p>


<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7120242057450442"
     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
</p>



<h2>Benefit #1: Deliver technology faster and at higher quality</h2>



<p>When your customers want more complex software products and expect you to deliver for them more quickly, the ways in which your company revolutionizes its product and service offerings will require a complete revamp. Collaboration and productivity enhancements brought about by DevOps are a big assist in meeting the innovation objectives of businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DevOps method of app development provides a company with a number of benefits, but the following five are the most important for any business that wishes to be inventive, available, and scalable. The following are those in question:</p>



<h3>Accelerate Time To Market</h3>



<p>DevOps reduces the amount of time it takes to bring a product to market, which in turn boosts business revenue. As a result of bringing together the IT and development teams to collaborate, the amount of time required to construct, test, and launch services or features is cut significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DevOps strategy enables businesses to rapidly introduce new features, rapidly improve already existing ones, and rapidly make these new or improved features available to users.</p>



<h3>Changing in Response to the Industry and Competition</h3>



<p>You have to consistently offer high-quality items if you want to succeed in an industry that is very competitive. Even if you had a fantastic idea for a business and had already started building it, that wouldn&#8217;t help you capture market share. You are in need of an improved strategy as well as a process, both of which are provided by DevOps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The delivery of new code is made both speedy and dependable thanks to DevOps. In addition, it allows teams to construct a scalable and robust application environment while still providing users with an outstanding experience. This approach not only helps acquire the market but also thrives in a competitive market by boosting the user base and income. In other words, it is a win-win situation.</p>



<h3>Keeping the System Reliable While Preserving Its Stability</h3>



<p>Continuous testing or automated testing is something that DevOps encourages. Testing that is automated enables engineers to provide test results that are more accurate, offer fast feedback on the build, and monitor the completion of all operations. When the team searches for results, the DevOps methodology provides time savings by accelerating the availability and the entire body of work related to results in analysis on each CI/CT cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This helps the team get results more quickly. The team is able to simply manage the system&#8217;s stability and dependability while also guaranteeing that the software products have excellent performance and availability.</p>



<h3>Bringing Down The Average Time To Recovery</h3>



<p>The bigger the financial effect that a corporation will have to deal with, the longer the MTTR will be. MTTR, which stands for &#8220;mean time to recovery,&#8221; is a problem that can be solved via DevOps. When a service experiences an outage, having DevOps in place may help speed up the process of repair, reaction, and recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It provides assistance for monitoring mission-critical systems, which enables users to gain real-time insights on decreased performance as well as entire outages caused by events and failures. The methodology of DevOps not only makes it easier to collect precise information but also makes the incident-management system more automated. In this method, it is feasible to swiftly address the issue, which will ultimately result in a reduced MTTR.</p>



<h3>Capabilities for Providing a Better Experience to Customers</h3>



<p>DevOps approaches also place an emphasis on the one-of-a-kind characteristics of software designed for the user experience. The development of both the quality of the software and the customer experience may be sped up with the use of DevOps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DevOps specialists monitor the customer&#8217;s point of view, plan sprints in accordance with that perspective, and test the product with the customer&#8217;s objective in mind. The team not only rapidly develops new features but also defines and enhances the whole customer journey for omnichannel.</p>

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
</p>



<h2>Benefit #2: React to changing market conditions more quickly</h2>



<p>These days, businesses undergo digital transformations by adopting innovative technology and methods. Keeping up with the digital economy is a top priority, and as a result, they are putting in extra effort to improve in all areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They need to improve their financial performance, product quality, product speed to market, and overall company adaptability. Maintaining competitive flexibility requires effective communication, collaboration, and bug-free code, all of which may be attained through the use of Agile and DevOps processes.</p>



<h3>Create a Culture-Oriented Structure</h3>



<p>It is common practice for an organization&#8217;s culture and structure to become one and the same. Teams need to adjust their mindset in order to use DevOps successfully. To put it simply, DevOps is a rearrangement of the teams and the way they work together and communicate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only when individuals work well together as a team can organizations make effective use of the available resources and technology. Both the development and operations teams need each other&#8217;s support. Being able to think critically sets humans apart from machines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, agile culture and the way humans naturally think are incompatible with the sequential waterfall paradigm. There is an urgent need to proactively address these difficulties, and the classic waterfall approach can do just that. It can also impart the benefits of the DevOps paradigm and harmonize the organizational structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will boost overall collaboration and adaptability and guarantee that the company&#8217;s culture and the culture of its employees are properly melded. By focusing on the whole value chain of software delivery, DevOps is the logical next step after Agile.</p>



<h3>Streamline Techniques, Procedures, and Policies</h3>



<p>Collaboration across the organization&#8217;s development, testing, infrastructure, and IT teams is essential. Thus, the organization&#8217;s rules, procedures, and processes should reflect this. DevOps needs to reevaluate its workflow, roles, responsibilities, and methodologies if it is to attain genuine agility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, they need to have a mentality that is consistent with the agile culture, which centers on producing incremental results and accommodating change. It&#8217;s not as simple as just adding weekly scrums on top of everything else, so be prepared for some complexity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Development and operations must collaborate with automation technologies and fully integrated processes to operate in a succession of brief efforts and genuinely execute production-ready code that can actually be delivered to clients.</p>



<h3>Streamline Rapid Growth with Minimal Discomfort</h3>



<p>Agility in DevOps is achieved by bringing together the principles of rapid development, high throughput, and careful scheduling to improve dependability and minimize disturbance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To take advantage of Agile&#8217;s rapid iteration cycles without sacrificing quality, the DevOps model may be used to zero in on the best approach and set you up with the best agile testing tools. It helps businesses find their footing so they can effectively and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and capitalize on emerging possibilities.</p>



<h3>Remove Organizational Barriers</h3>



<p>Organizational agility may be improved by closing the communication and collaboration gaps across departments like operations, development, and testing. By enabling continuous development, testing, and deployment with a reliable toolchain, agility may be accomplished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a tight coupling between the teams, instruments, and procedures in this method. The success of the DevOps model relies on effective communication and cooperation between several functional teams, which guarantees zero barriers across multiple agile teams supported by the proper collaboration technologies.</p>



<h3>Maintain Constant Monitoring</h3>



<p>For DevOps to be effective and for a plan to be developed, feedback is essential. Having fast and accurate input is crucial to the success of a DevOps approach. Each deployment should record the basic metrics of duration, expense, and quality. Over time, this information may be examined to determine DevOps&#8217;s efficiency and adaptability and to pinpoint problem spots.</p>



<p>Culture-based indicators like team cohesion, the average time to resolve conflicts, sense of pride and ownership, and so on can be challenging to quantify. When determining the speed and efficiency of DevOps, however, these cultural criteria are crucial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizational culture, methods, mentality, and toolchain should be streamlined in order to expand the DevOps model and keep it agile and relevant for providing excellent deliveries. For this reason, it is essential to employ experienced teams that can work together to concentrate on constant development and evaluation.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>By focusing on the whole value chain of software delivery, DevOps is the logical next step after Agile. Additionally, the DevOps model helps businesses find their footing so they can effectively and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and capitalize on emerging possibilities.</p>
