<p>The performance of the <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> cycle is a crucial measure of your success. If it’s good, you are on track to meet your objectives; if it’s bad, you need to make some changes. The DevOps cycle performance has three main factors: lead time, cycle time, and throughput.</p>



<p>You can use these metrics to inform your team about where there may be issues in your process that need addressing. Each of these factors indicates a different part of the DevOps cycle:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lead time</strong> refers to the total length of time from when an order is placed until it is sent out for delivery.</li>



<li><strong>Cycle time</strong> is how long it takes from when a new version of code is checked in to when it becomes available for production users. It measures how much time elapses between every phase of production and points out potential bottlenecks in your process.</li>



<li><strong>Throughput</strong> measures how many units are produced within a specific timeframe (e.g., the number of orders per hour).</li>
</ul>



<p>When monitoring the performance of these metrics, it is important to keep them balanced across all three categories; if one value falls too low or high, adjustments may need to be made.</p>



<h2>Lead Time</h2>



<p>The lead time is the length of time it takes from when an order is placed until it is sent out for delivery. To improve this, you can look at two aspects of your process: Shipping and Demand management.</p>



<p>If shipping is taking a long time, check that your team is following a strict process for shipping that is as streamlined as possible. This way, it will be much easier to track and make improvements. If demand management is the issue, you might need to review your sales strategy.</p>



<p>How many orders are being placed per day is the first thing to look at. If demand is low, you can consider ways to increase it, such as marketing campaigns. If orders are high, you might have trouble meeting them due to the length of time it takes to process them. If it is taking a long time to fulfill orders, you can use a kanban board to track them and make sure they don’t get stuck in the process.</p>



<h2>Cycle Time</h2>



<p>Cycle time is the time it takes from when a new version of code is checked in to when that code becomes available for production users. It measures how much time elapses between every phase of production and points out potential bottlenecks in your process.</p>



<p>To improve this, you can look at two aspects of your process: Code deployment and Testing. If it is taking a long time to deploy code, check the tools you are using; they may not be working as efficiently as they could. If testing is taking too long, you might need to add more resources to your testing team.</p>



<h2>Throughput</h2>



<p>Throughput is the number of units produced within a specific timeframe. If throughput is low, you may have too high a lead time for your cycle time. This can be corrected by improving your shipping process or by reducing the time it takes to produce the product.</p>



<p>If throughput is high, you may have too low a cycle time for your lead time. This can be corrected by reducing the time it takes to produce the product or by increasing the time it takes to send it out.</p>



<h2>Continuous Improvement Strategies</h2>



<p>There are several strategies you can employ to improve the efficiency of your DevOps cycle, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reducing the time it takes to complete all processes, such as testing and deployment.</li>



<li>Reallocating employees to where they are needed most, such as adding more people to your testing team if testing is taking too long.</li>



<li>Streamlining processes, such as using a kanban board to improve visibility and reduce bottlenecks.</li>



<li>Improving software quality, such as using automated tests and code reviews to catch issues early.</li>



<li>Improving your customer experience, such as tracking customer complaints and addressing them promptly.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The performance of the DevOps cycle is a crucial measure of your success. If it’s good, you are on track to meet your objectives; if it’s bad, you need to make some changes. The DevOps cycle performance has three main factors: lead time, cycle time, and throughput.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> is an approach to software development and operation, where teams are able to collaborate more effectively and accelerate software releases from development to production. As a result, organizations can release new features faster and with higher quality.</p>



<p>The need for speed and collaboration across departments is what’s driving many organizations toward DevOps. But it’s not just about faster software releases; it’s about releasing better software faster by enabling the people who build and support applications (known as operators) to react to changing conditions quickly, proactively, and directly.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we will discuss why monitoring and feedback are critical in accelerating your path toward DevOps while maintaining your company’s high standards for quality.</p>

<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>



<p>DevOps is a set of principles and practices that promotes collaboration between software developers and Operations engineers/IT professionals. It is a cultural change that advocates for a focus on automation, continuous testing, and bringing software development and IT operations together so that you create a more stable application environment.</p>



<p>Because the application lifecycle is shorter, it makes the need for monitoring even more important. Monitoring provides visibility into the application environment and alerts when things are not running as expected. Achieving the right balance between operational efficiency and customer experience is key in the DevOps world. DevOps is a journey and not a destination.</p>



<p>You are always improving and tweaking. The organizations that truly embrace DevOps culture are the ones that see the most benefits. Companies that have a strong engineering culture, a high bar for quality, and a strong set of values are the organizations that have the best chance of succeeding in the DevOps world.</p>



<h2>The Importance of Monitoring in a DevOps Environment</h2>



<p>As we’ve discussed, there are many benefits to implementing a DevOps model versus a traditional software development lifecycle. But what exactly does monitoring have to do with DevOps? It’s no coincidence that monitoring is one of the core components of DevOps.</p>



<p>The mere act of monitoring software, infrastructure, and network performance is the important first step in taking advantage of the benefits of DevOps. And when you’re monitoring, you’re also able to analyze and gain insight into your current state based on real-time data.</p>



<p>While companies are in the process of implementing a DevOps approach, monitoring becomes even more important as it can help you identify potential bottlenecks in your software delivery pipeline.</p>



<h2>Why is Monitoring so Important in a DevOps Environment?</h2>



<p>All organizations should be monitoring their software and the underlying infrastructure on which their applications run. But when you’re implementing a DevOps approach, monitoring becomes even more important because it provides visibility into the application environment and alerts when things are not running as expected.</p>



<p>With a traditional software development lifecycle, engineers would build the application, test it, and then push it out to a staging server environment where operations professionals would monitor it to make sure it’s up and running. When the app was determined to be good to go, the operations team would then push it out to production.</p>



<p>In a DevOps environment, the handoff between development and operations happens much more frequently. In some cases, developers may be responsible for deploying to production or at the very least, testing their code on staging servers before operations engineers deploy it to production.</p>



<h2>Benefits of monitoring in a DevOps environment</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Increased insight into the current state: </strong>Monitoring gives you the ability to see and understand the current state of your applications, network, and infrastructure. Without monitoring, you would have no visibility into the current state, which makes it more difficult to identify issues and resolve them.</li>



<li><strong>Sensitivity to application issues: </strong>When you’re monitoring, you’re able to quickly detect issues, both big and small, that disrupt the flow of your business. This includes issues such as a website or app outage, poor performance, increased latency, security issues, and more.</li>



<li><strong>Ability to resolve issues quickly: </strong>When monitoring is part of your software delivery pipeline and you’re able to recognize and resolve issues quickly, you’re able to decrease the amount of time it takes to restore normal operations.</li>



<li><strong>Predictability: </strong>Monitoring also gives you the ability to predict what will happen next, which can be helpful when planning for upcoming events such as conferences or holidays. By understanding the current state, you can predict what might happen next and prepare for it.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Monitor constantly to understand the current state continuously</h2>



<h3>Machine Data</h3>



<p>Data points that are generated and collected by application and infrastructure monitoring tools are known as machine data. Machine data is a fantastic source of data to understand the current state of your applications. Machine data is generated and collected at the application level, which gives you an accurate representation of what is happening in your environment.</p>



<h3>Human-Generated Data</h3>



<p>As you’re monitoring, you also capture human-generated data, which is data that is entered into the system manually. For example, if you receive a ticket about a performance issue, this would be recorded as human-generated data. Although human-generated data is not as accurate as machine data, it gives insight into what is happening in the application environment.</p>



<h2>Monitor constantly to understand why something happened</h2>



<p>Monitoring gives you the ability to understand why something happened, which can be beneficial when it comes to debugging issues and resolving them quickly.</p>



<h3>Application Logs</h3>



<p>Application logs are a fantastic source of why something happened because they show a timeline of events. This can help you identify bottlenecks in your application, when various events occur, when errors are thrown, and much more.</p>



<h3>Tracing</h3>



<p>Tracing is another source of why something happened. Tracing is a way to visualize the path that packets take as they move through the network. This can be helpful if you notice something in the application logs, but you’re not sure where the problem is.</p>



<h2>Monitor Constantly to Predict What Will Happen Next</h2>



<p>Monitoring gives you the ability to predict what will happen next by giving you insight into the current state as well as why certain things happened. This can be helpful when planning for upcoming events such as conferences or holidays.</p>



<h3>Application Performance</h3>



<p>By understanding the current state, you can predict what will happen next with application performance. This can help you proactively prepare for upcoming events that require a heavier lift, such as sales or Black Friday events.</p>



<h3>Network Performance</h3>



<p>Monitoring also allows you to understand the current state of network performance. This can help you predict what will happen next by allowing you to proactively prepare for higher levels of network traffic.</p>

		<title>Why You Need to Build A Culture of Trust and Respect in DevOps</title>

<p>Trust and respect are essential ingredients in any healthy working environment. When trust and respect are present, team members feel safe to give their best, collaborate openly, and challenge one another constructively.</p>



<p>When trust and respect are absent, team members feel insecure about their performance, withhold ideas for fear of judgement or worry about repercussions if they speak up.</p>



<p>There is an inherent risk in bringing together people from different backgrounds with different skill sets. And in the context of <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a>, you’re also putting together people who likely have very different roles within your organization as well. The potential for discord is high.</p>



<p>So how do you create a culture of trust and respect when working with so many new and different people? Here’s why you need to build a culture of trust and respect in your DevOps initiative.</p>



<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7120242057450442"
     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h2>It’s the Foundation for Good Communication</h2>



<p>Communication is the foundation for everything in DevOps. You have to be able to openly share what’s working, what isn’t, and why without judgement, without fear of repercussions, and without ego getting in the way.</p>



<p>What happens when, in a meeting, someone says they aren’t getting the information they need from a team member? Or that they feel rushed to get their job done? Or that they aren’t seeing the value in the continuous integration process?</p>



<p>Without a culture of trust and respect, communication will be strained. Team members will be hesitant to speak up, and afraid of judgement. They’ll feel anxious like they don’t have permission to be honest with the team.</p>



<p>And if they don’t feel safe speaking up, the communication breaks down, and the DevOps initiative will suffer as a result.</p>



<h2>It Builds Confidence for Everyone</h2>



<p>One of the biggest challenges in DevOps is building trust between different people, and different parts of the organization. But if you lack the confidence to speak up, you’ll never be able to build that trust missing out on the opportunity to learn from your colleagues and grow yourself as a result.</p>



<p>In a culture where trust and respect are absent, people are less likely to share their ideas, and more likely to either shut down and not try at all, speak up in ways that create discord, and don’t encourage others to respond.</p>



<p>You need to feel confident to share your ideas, challenge others, and learn from both your successes and your mistakes. Without trust and respect, you won’t feel confident enough to do any of these things, and again, the DevOps initiative will suffer as a result.</p>



<h2>It Creates a Safe Environment For Learning</h2>



<p>A healthy DevOps culture needs to create a safe environment for learning. This means not only being transparent about what’s working and what isn’t, but also being open to feedback without fear of judgement.</p>



<p>This is the best way to identify pain points and areas where improvement is needed. When team members feel safe to share their feedback, they can do so in a way that doesn’t create any sense of judgement, but rather, encourages the team to look at the information objectively and decide how to act on it.</p>



<p>But when a team is operating in a culture where trust and respect aren’t present, this kind of feedback is very tricky to navigate. Because team members are likely to feel anxious about sharing their true feelings and experiences, and will likely speak up in ways that are designed to minimise judgement. This can lead to misunderstood feedback, and squashing the open and objective dialogue that is needed for improvement.</p>



<h2>DevOps is About People and Culture</h2>



<p>All of the above leads us to one important conclusion: building a healthy DevOps culture is about people and trust. Building trust and respect is never a one-time thing, and it requires a sustained effort from all members of the team, regardless of their backgrounds.</p>



<p>When you see a team member struggling to find their footing, or growing frustrated at their role, you have to be willing to lend a helping hand. And to do this, you must first be aware of your own behaviour and how you’re modelling the behaviour you want to see.</p>



<p>You must be willing to confront your own behaviours that are likely to be creating a culture that is lacking in trust and respect. And you must be willing to take ownership of your own feelings and be open about how they are impacting your work and the team as a whole.</p>

</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>DevOps is all about collaboration, communication and cooperation. When everyone on the team trusts and respects each other, they are much more likely to collaborate effectively. This can only happen when everyone feels safe to give their opinion and be open about their needs. Building a culture of trust and respect will take time and effort. However, it is well worth the effort as it will lead to better communication, a healthier team, and ultimately better results for your organization.</p>

It’s a term used to describe practices and technologies aimed at bringing together software engineers and IT professionals to produce software more efficiently.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll cover the main principles of DevOps and its interrelation with Agile. It can be challenging for teams that are new to both concepts at the same time, but they really make sense when taken in their entirety. In other words, by following these steps, you’ll be able to create an effective DevOps culture within your organization.</p>



<p>So, how do agile and DevOps interrelate?</p>



<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7120242057450442"
     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>



<p>DevOps is a transformation aimed at integrating the software development and operations teams from a business perspective. It’s a combination of techniques found in Lean and Agile methodologies, and it’s used to transform the way organizations produce software.</p>



<p>DevOps merges the disciplines of development and operations to create a more efficient process that successfully addresses the challenges faced by businesses today. DevOps is an umbrella term that describes a set of processes aimed at bridging the gap between software development and IT operations.</p>



<p>I think this is the first key to explaining how agile and DevOps interrelate. In a more traditional approach, there are generally a series of handoffs between different responsibilities in an organization. When trying to understand how agile and DevOps work together, start by visualizing a world where handoffs do not happen anymore. This will immediately produce savings over the life cycle of your products.</p>



<p>Agile teams are also unique in their own right when compared to a more traditional organizational structure. An agile team is going to consistently be reviewing their development processes for areas of improvement. This is going to allow for meaningful growth and promote a model focused on continuous integration and continuous delivery.</p>



<h2>What Makes DevOps Different from Other Methodologies?</h2>



<p>DevOps integrates the development and operations teams into a single functional delivery team. From a business perspective, it focuses on creating product delivery cycles that solve real problems instead of just churning out code for the sake of producing code.</p>



<p>By combining these disciplines developers can spend less time dealing with the complexities of big bang releases and more time creating new rapidly developed incremental features. This is because the process is automated.</p>



<p>This helps organizations achieve high software quality, fast delivery, and easier adaptation to the market. To end-users, DevOps looks like this: When a team of developers wants to create a new feature, they can rapidly plan, prototype, adjust, and release that feature to start realizing the value of that work.</p>



<p>Agile development methodologies are usually found with any functional DevOps team. When looking at a more traditional project management methodology like Waterfall, anyone trying to implement DevOps will generally stop short at automating infrastructure as code. A project utilizing the Agile DevOps methodology will take that several steps further.</p>



<p>An Agile DevOps team will focus on automating the entire process. Continuous integration will be utilized as a cornerstone to build a robust framework to test and deploy their software. The end goal is to transition into a model of continuous delivery to enable many releases to production in a single day.</p>



<p>Day 2 operations will be integrated into their technology pipelines as well. Tools and automation will be built to take care of more routine tasks such as certificate renewals or auto-remediation. Because DevOps pipelines are test-driven, future unexpected changes are also quickly identified and fixed much more easily.</p>



<h2>What Makes a More Traditional SDLC Risky?</h2>



<p>When working in a more traditional software methodology software moves down an assembly line with bigger changes leading to larger risk.</p>



<p>New features are approved and then tested, followed by regression, and finally deployed to production. This is the most traditional way to work with code. However, it is not always the most efficient way to work with code.</p>



<p>Changes to the code base should be approached from the perspective of the risk involved with any change. When working with big changes in the code base, it is important to look at the big picture of the software. If you are only focused on one aspect of the software, even though it might be the most crucial aspect, you risk overlooking something else that is just as important.</p>



<p>Big-picture thinking is achieved by working with the whole software. If you are building a new feature, you need to start with a new branch of the code base. Without testing the new code, you risk breaking something else in the software. Once you are sure there are no errors in the new code, you can start the testing process. After you are certain the new code has no bugs, you can release it to your production environment.</p>



<p>When the process relies on larger changes, with more complex processes, and more opinions about quality in every decision being made down the assembly line there is a higher likelihood that project timelines will slip or never be delivered at all.</p>



<h2>The Importance of Collaboration in DevOps</h2>



<p>DevOps is the marriage between software development and IT operations. It’s a term used to describe practices and technologies aimed at bringing together software engineers and IT professionals to produce software more efficiently.</p>



<p>In this marriage, there must be a collaboration between the teams involved. This collaboration allows for a better understanding of each other’s roles, and for the shared goal of creating better software with minimal time and effort.</p>



<p>DevOps is key to transforming the operations side of an organization and allowing everyone involved to create high-quality, reliable software. And collaboration between the teams is what allows for this.</p>



<h2>Establishing a Culture of Collaboration for Success in DevOps</h2>



<p>Before you can start implementing DevOps in your organization, you need to establish a culture of collaboration between the teams involved. DevOps is a marriage between teams, and successful marriages are built on communication and a mutual understanding of what both parties bring to the table.</p>



<p>To create this culture, you’ll want to start by determining which members of your organization are involved in the transformation. You can do this by identifying the individuals who are responsible for bringing the different teams together (such as product managers, architects, developers, and operations staff).</p>



<p>You can also do a deeper dive into how the teams interact with each other. Ask yourself:</p>



<ul><li>What information does each team need from the other?</li><li>What do they do with that information?</li><li>What are their roles and responsibilities?</li></ul>



<p>This will help you determine where the gaps are between the teams and what needs to change.</p>

<h2>What is Agile?</h2>



<p>Agile has been used in the software development community for a long time, but DevOps has brought it to the forefront.</p>



<p>Agile is a collection of methodologies based on rapid, evolutionary development. It’s about understanding your business needs and developing products and services to meet them.</p>



<p>This type of development is often referred to as evolutionary development, and it’s meant to be a continuous process. This means that in order to adjust to changes in your business, you’ll need to adjust your processes accordingly.</p>



<p>Evolutionary development has many advantages over traditional methods of development, such as waterfall. Waterfall is a method that focuses on a single target release date, and it’s often used in traditional methodologies.</p>



<h2>The Importance of Agility in Digital Development</h2>



<p>Agile development emphasizes the need for constant communication and collaboration between the teams responsible for product development. This communication is key to the success of the transformation, and it’s achieved by bringing together architects, product managers, developers, and operations staff.</p>



<p>By bringing everyone together, you’ll be able to understand their roles and responsibilities and make adjustments as necessary. And, most importantly, you’ll be able to communicate better and collaborate.</p>



<p>By developing products and services that respond to the needs of your customers, you’ll be able to create better software with minimal effort.</p>



<p>When you develop products that your customers actually want, they’re going to be much happier with your software. It’s important to remember that creating customer value is the goal of every business process. Finding ways to make your own business process more efficient is important, but it’s even more critical to focus on customer value.</p>



<h2>Interaction Between Agile and DevOps Principles</h2>



<p>Many people are under the assumption that DevOps and Agile are two different methods, when, in fact, they’re both about rapid, continuous improvement. There are some differences between them, but both focus on bringing the best out of their team members.</p>



<p>Both DevOps and Agile are about collaboration between teams, and both aim to create high-quality, reliable software. But clearly, there are differences between the two. Let’s take a look at some of the similarities between the two methodologies.</p>



<p>Both DevOps and Agile work best when they are integrated. The goal of an integrated approach is to produce high-quality software as quickly as possible. Through the collaboration between developers, testers, operations staff, and other members of the team, you can achieve a faster turnaround time for your software.</p>



<p>To make this collaboration possible, teams must adhere to certain principles such as communication, consistency, and agility.</p>



<p>Additionally, an integrated DevOps and Agile approach can help to reduce the risk of software defects. To accomplish this, you must work with your team to create automated tests for your software.</p>



<p>By integrating DevOps and Agile development processes, you can increase your team’s overall quality. Through testing, you can catch problems before they are shipped to customers. Operations can also be integrated into the process, reducing bottlenecks and increasing the speed of software releases.</p>



<p>These principles aren’t rigid rules; rather, they’re guidelines for implementing good practices for developing software and delivering it more efficiently. They aren’t meant to replace traditional methods of doing business or IT operations; rather, they complement them in order to achieve greater results as quickly as possible.</p>



<h3>Being Agile with DevOps</h3>



<p>DevOps is based on an Agile mindset. It’s an approach to agile software development and software delivery. This means developers and operations professionals must collaborate closely to create a better product in the shortest amount of time possible.</p>



<h3>Being Lean with DevOps</h3>



<p>Lean principles are also important in DevOps, but they are used differently than they are in traditional lean methodologies. These principles focus on continuous improvement, continuous learning, and continuous feedback. The overall goal is to make the process more efficient by minimizing waste and increasing quality.</p>



<h2>Limitations of Traditional Methods of Software Development</h2>



<p>Traditional methodologies are focused on creating a single version of the truth, which can be a limitation if you want to adapt to changing business needs. DevOps, on the other hand, is all about continuous change, so it can be challenging to adapt to that. While related, the need to be agile is a significant difference between DevOps and traditional methodologies.</p>



<h2>Advantages of DevOps over Traditionally practiced methodologies</h2>



<p>The main advantage of DevOps over traditional methodologies is that it helps organizations create better software with minimal effort. With traditional methodologies, such as Waterfall, there is a high probability that the software will not be delivered on time and within budget, and that can be a significant problem. With DevOps, on the other hand, it’s important to note that there’s a difference between creating better software and just producing more of it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>DevOps is a transformation aimed at bringing together the disciplines of development and operations to produce high-quality software. It’s a marriage between the teams involved, and it needs to be built on communication and collaboration. DevOps is key to transforming operations and allowing everyone to create high-quality, reliable software. And collaboration between teams is what allows for this. DevOps is the marriage between software engineers and IT professionals.</p>

<p>This post will help anyone who is attempting to use <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Ansible">ansible</a> to modify files on VMs running on ESXI via automation when <a href="https://www.valewood.org/practicing-devops/">Practicing DevOps</a>.  This method assumes that you have cloned out a machine, but do not yet have network access to that machine meaning you would need to utilize native ESXi methods to get communication setup.  </p>



<p>I use methods like this in my home lab to help stay current with new trends in <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> Not everyone is going to be fortunate enough to have cloud playgrounds to test out new things, and home labs are a great way to make a one-time investment in your future.</p>



<p>The code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/gwagner/ansible-examples/tree/main/modify-vmware-esxi-guest-file" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/gwagner/ansible-examples/tree/main/modify-vmware-esxi-guest-file" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p>

</p>



<h2>Prerequisites</h2>



<p>This article is going to assume that you already have VMWare running in a home lab somewhere. This also assumes that you have some familiarity with VMware and networking.</p>



<p>This post will also assume that you have already installed a baseline OS running open-vm-tools. <a href="https://www.packer.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="17" title="Packer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packer</a><a href="https://www.packer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a> is a good tool to use to automate your baseline operating system installation to create a reusable disk image.</p>



<p>You may also want to read <a href="https://www.valewood.org/ansible-create-vmware-esxi-vm/" data-type="post" data-id="1213">this post</a> to get a good feeling about how to automate cloning images when vSphere or Center are not available solutions.</p>



<h2>The Playbook</h2>



<p>Below is the full code to copy SSH keys to a newly cloned machine, and set an IP address with a NetworkManager restart.</p>



<p>The general idea is to run <code>ansible-playbook modify-vmware-esxi-guest-file.yaml -i inventory.yaml</code> from your command line.  The playbook will then connect to ESXi and create a .ssh folder on your fresh machine.  It will then copy your local <code>/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> file to the remote machine.  Finally, it will run <code>/bin/nmcli </code>commands to get a static IP address set on the VM.</p>



<p>A majority of this playbook is also setup with <code>delegate_to: localhost</code>. This means that the computer running the ansible script will also execute anything with the defined <code><code>delegate_to</code>: localhost</code>. Since the remote machine from inventory exists but is not yet able to be connected to <code><code>delegate_to</code>: localhost</code> is necessary of you would immediately receive an ansible connection error.</p>

<h2>Task By Task Breakdown</h2>



<p>To not rehash details I have gone through in other articles, you can find a breakdown of the inventory, credentials, and config in <a href="https://www.valewood.org/ansible-create-vmware-esxi-vm/#penci-A-Task-By-Task-Breakdown" data-type="URL" data-id="/ansible-create-vmware-esxi-vm/#penci-A-Task-By-Task-Breakdown">this post.</a></p>



<p>The first step of this playbook is to create a users .ssh folder so an authorized_keys file can be created.  The playbook makes an assumption that your user is named&#8230; user, but that could be modified and turned into a configuration parameter pretty quickly.  I will break down each of the config parameters below:</p>



<ul><li>validate_certs is set to false because most of us are not going to be using trusted 3rd party certs in our VMware environment. If you are doing this in a professional environment, ensure you have valid certs installed and leave validate_certs set to the default of true.</li><li>validate_certs should also be set to false if you are connecting to your VMWare server via IP address since your cert will not match an IP address.</li><li>vmware_user and vmware_password should be set to a user that has SSH access to your VMWare server. I would not recommend that you do this in any sort of production environment, but it is perfectly fine for a home lab.</li><li>datacenter is set to ha-datacenter. This is the default name of a “datacenter” in ESXi. There is no reason to change this.</li><li>vm_id is either the exact case-sensitive name of the virtual machine being configured.  If you created your machine using ansible, then make sure you map the name you gave it here via variables.</li><li>vm_username and vm_password is in reference to the user you setup when creating your template or disk image.  ESXi needs this to effectively run an interactive login to the server to perform your commands.</li><li>directory is signifying that our action is going to be taken on a directory.  In the next task you will see that we use the copy key instead of directory but we are utilizing the exact same module.</li><li>directory.path is the path on the ESXi guests that you want to take action on.</li><li>directory.operation denotes what we want to have happen.  In this case, we are going to create a directory.</li><li>directory.recurse tells ansible if it should send a command that recursively creates directories.  If your default user is not named user, you would end up with a /home/user/.ssh directory that will be fairly useless.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Create .ssh folder
      community.vmware.vmware_guest_file_operation:
        validate_certs: false
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        username: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        password: "{{ vmware_password }}"
        datacenter: ha-datacenter
        vm_id: "{{ vmware.name }}"
        vm_username: "{{ centos_template_user }}"
        vm_password: "{{ centos_template_password }}"
        directory:
          path: "/home/user/.ssh/"
          operation: create
          recurse: no
      delegate_to: localhost</code></pre>



<p>This next task does a copy of a file from the machine you executed the ansible playbook from onto the ESXi guest that we are configuring.  In the interest of brevity, I am not going to rehash the duplicate keys from above.  Here are the specific keys of interest in this task:</p>



<ul><li>copy denotes that we want to copy a file.  The file needs to exist on your source system and will be copied to the ESXi guest.</li><li>copy.src is the path to the source file.  As you can see, we are targeting the public key here.</li><li>copy.dest is the full path to the destination.   As you can see we are targeting an authorized_keys file as the destination.  This could be dangerous if that file already exists as it will be overwritten.</li><li>copy.overwrite ensures that we will clobber whatever exists on the destination system with the file from our source system.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Copy RSA to VM
      community.vmware.vmware_guest_file_operation:
        validate_certs: false
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        username: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        password: "{{ vmware_password }}"
        datacenter: ha-datacenter
        vm_id: "{{ vmware.name }}"
        vm_username: "{{ centos_template_user }}"
        vm_password: "{{ centos_template_password }}"
        copy:
          src: "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
          dest: "/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys"
          overwrite: yes
      delegate_to: localhost</code></pre>

</p>



<p>This last task is composed a bit differently.  Effectively it is being used to run a series of nmcli commands along with a single systemctl command to set a static IP address for this machine.  I have this task composed this way to clean up ansible code.  This could be written as six fully independent tasks in ansible, but remember to stay DRY and don&#8217;t repeat yourself.  Here is a breakdown of the specific keys of interest:</p>



<ul><li>vm_shell represents the exact path to the command that is going to be run on the ESXi guest.  Do not include command arguments in this field, the documentation specifically states that it wants a full path to an executable.</li><li>vm_shell_args represents the arguments to the vm_shell command.  </li><li>loop controls how the task will loop through the data defined underneath.  I have the keys setup as dictionary objects so that we get both shell executables and arguments from the loop.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>    - name: Run command inside a virtual machine
      community.vmware.vmware_vm_shell:
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"

        - { shell: "/bin/nmcli", args: "connection modify ens192 IPv4.method manual" }
        - { shell: "/bin/systemctl", args: "NetworkManager restart" }
      delegate_to: localhost</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, with a fairly concise set of steps, you can level up your DevOps automation game by rapidly configuring virtual machines in your home lab.</p>

	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h2>A Basic Breakdown of the Attack</h2>



<p>The attack was first identified when automated scanning identified some obscurely named images on DockerHub were being updated through automated patterns that did not match any kind of heuristic pattern.  From there, it appears that free-tier GitHub accounts were being created and each account allows for 2000 minutes per month of free GitHub Actions runtime.  Repositories were then created and a specially crafted <code>github-actions.yaml</code> workflow was created in those repositories.  Containers were then started which kick off crypto mining operations.  Ports are also opened up to serve as command and control for the distributed attack.</p>



<p>To get the full details of the attack, which are extremely fascinating, I would look into the article linked at the top of this post.  There are a ton of depth and built-in workarounds to combat the systems of control that GitHub has in place to protect its infrastructure from attack.</p>



<h2>What is the Threat of a Poorly Secured Code Repository?</h2>



<p>Supply chain attacks have become commonplace in software development.  Companies are constantly chasing CVEs from packages that are either not being well maintained by the community or are being maintained but companies are not allocating enough funding to keep their software in line with community updates.  </p>



<p>The most pronounced threat in recent memory was <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Log4j remote code execution bug</a> found in versions below 2.16.  This allowed attackers to craft a simple attack that was able to quickly run arbitrary code that could have real consequences.</p>



<p>Companies all over the planet rushed to update their code bases.  You can find massive Reddit threads that were discussing their companies&#8217; responses to the issue.  I would imagine, even with all of the industry hype, this vulnerability still exists in the wild and is still being exploited.</p>



<p>How can something like this be avoided in the future?  People familiar with DevOps automation will quickly reply by adding more automation to their environments and building systems.  While I completely agree with this response, if automation is added irresponsibly the threat landscape you are looking at will broaden very quickly.</p>



<p>In high school, I was enrolled in vocational education where I learned how to build a shed.  It was a pretty awesome experience and I learned a lot.  The shop teacher in charge of running the class and keeping the students safe was generally opposed to using power tools to aid in our learning.  When approached as to why his response was simply this; &#8220;power tools are just going to ensure that you kids screw something up faster than with hand tools&#8221;.</p>



<p>When adding automation to an environment, especially in concert with code repositories and build systems, you are opening yourself up to a lot of risks that need to be mitigated.  If your pipelines are fully automated from commit through production, then all it takes is one simple push before disaster strikes.</p>



<p>Tom Scott from &#8220;Things You Might Not Know&#8221; does a pretty good theoretical exercise about how quickly things can go wrong in a scenario like this.  I have added the video below.</p>

<h2>What Does PurpleUchin mean for DevOps and Automation?</h2>



<p>PURPLEURCHIN appears to be a fairly sophisticated vehicle to utilize free computing resources to mine cryptocurrency.  On its face, a group is just trying to make a buck.</p>



<p>On its face, it does not seem very threatening.  This kind of attack really shows not only the creativity of attackers today, but it highlights how complex a company&#8217;s technology stack has gotten, and how easy it is to hide inside of it.  </p>



<p>Here are some questions that you can ask yourself to understand your level of visibility:</p>



<ul><li>Would you know if all of the code that made it into production on your next release was intentionally put there by good actors?</li><li>Would you know if your servers are only running what you intended for them to be running?</li><li>Could a sidecar process be spun up by a bad actor and would anybody notice?</li><li>Does your automated testing stack take environmental considerations into account when passing a build?</li><li>Do you know what versions of 3rd party dependencies are running in your environment?</li><li>Would you know if a 3rd party dependency has been compromised?</li><li>Could you quickly replace a compromised dependency to ensure business continuity?</li><li>Do you know if your organization is utilizing GitHub Actions workflows that have been vetted by the security community?</li></ul>



<p>Now, these questions may seem like a little bit of fear-mongering, and that is intentional.  There are solutions for every single one of these already-solved problems on the market.  In my experience, companies are not always going that extra mile to ensure that they are protected from threat actors.</p>



<p>The factors that compound all of this are speed and automation.  I don&#8217;t think anybody will dispute the argument that the technology space moves extremely quickly.  On top of that, businesses must ship and release software at the pace of the market to remain competitive.  Because of that speed, automation is generally employed as a stop-gap to maintain a consistent pace.  Businesses have the possibility of leaving themselves exposed if those automated tools are not held to a higher standard than the software they are developing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>PURPLEURCHIN serves as another reminder about the time and attention we need to pay to our supply chain and automated tool stacks.  While this particular attack does not constitute immediate concern for the technology community holistically like Log4J did, it serves as a great reminder that technology hygiene is as important as shipping valuable technology solutions to the market.</p>

<p>This post will help anyone who is attempting to use <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Ansible">Ansible</a> to create new VMs with automation when <a href="https://www.valewood.org/practicing-devops/" data-type="post" data-id="14">Practicing DevOps</a>.  I use this in my home lab to help stay current with new trends in <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a>.  Not everyone is going to be fortunate enough to have cloud playgrounds to test out new things, and home labs are a great way to make a one-time investment in your future.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>



<p>This article is going to assume that you already have VMWare running in a home lab somewhere.  This also assumes that you have some familiarity with VMware and networking.</p>



<p>This post will also assume that you have already installed a baseline OS.  <a href="https://www.packer.io/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="17" title="Packer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packer</a> is a good tool to use to automate your baseline operating system installation to create a reusable disk image.</p>



<h2>The Playbook</h2>



<p>Below is the full code to deploy a virtual machine from a disk image.  </p>



<p>The general idea is to run <code>ansible-playbook create-vmware-esxi-vm.yaml -i inventory.yaml</code> from your command line.  The playbook will then check to see if a machine exists.  If set to destructive, it will then delete any machine with the same name, copy an existing disk image, set some machine specifics like IP address, and then power on your machine.</p>



<p>VMWare vSphere makes this a fairly novel activity via the use of templates.  A standalone ESXi node does not have the benefit of templates which is why things get a bit more complex in this space.</p>



<p>A majority of this playbook is also setup with <code>delegate_to: localhost</code>.  This means that the computer running the ansible script will also execute anything with the defined <code><code>delegate_to</code>: localhost</code>.  The remote machine from inventory does not yet exist, which means; if <code><code>delegate_to</code>: localhost</code> was not set, you would immediately receive an ansible connection error.</p>

<h2>A Task By Task Breakdown</h2>



<p>First, we should look at the inventory.</p>



<p>This example has only one example host defined in it under a group called example.  You are able to define as many hosts in inventory that you would like.  </p>



<p>The structure of the vars defined under example-01.valewood.lab are there to provide everything the playbook needs in order to provision a server in ESXi.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>---
all:
  hosts:
  children:
    example:
      hosts:
        example-01.valewood.lab:
          ip: 192.168.1.10 
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.10
          vmware:
            ip_address: 192.168.1.10
            gateway_address: 192.168.1.1
            dns_address: 192.168.1.1
            netmask: 255.255.255.0
            mac_address: "00:16:3E:A0:06:43"
            memory_mb: 8192
            name: example-01
            num_cpus: 4
            port_group: Example-App
            guest_id: centos64Guest
            disks: &#091;]</code></pre>



<p>Below is the code that reads in configurations and credentials.  These are broken up into 2 different files because credentials should always be encrypted and never stored in plaintext.  </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - include_vars: config.yaml
      delegate_to: localhost

    - include_vars: creds.yaml # Remember, this should be in a vault
      delegate_to: localhost   # These creds are for example use only</code></pre>



<p>The next step is to check to see if a VM exists in VMWare or not with the same name.  This is a crucial step to ensure that duplicate names are not used in VMWare.  Here are some key notes about additional configurations:</p>



<ul><li>validate_certs is set to false because most of us are not going to be using trusted 3rd party certs in our VMware environment.  If you are doing this in a professional environment, ensure you have valid certs installed and leave validate_certs set to the default of true.</li><li>validate_certs should also be set to false if you are connecting to your VMWare server via IP address since your cert will not match an IP address.</li><li>vmware_user and vmware_password should be set to a user that has SSH access to your VMWare server.  I would not recommend that you do this in any sort of production environment, but it is perfectly fine for a home lab.</li><li>datacenter is set to ha-datacenter.  This is the default name of a &#8220;datacenter&#8221; in ESXi.  There is no reason to change this.</li><li>throttle is set to 1 to provide time to ctrl+c IF you happen to run your playbook by mistake against many machines at once.</li><li>destructive is a variable that can be set which tells this playbook to not destroy and rebuild machines if they already exist.  By default, the destructive variable it is not defined which means a check will be performed.</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>    - name: Check if virtual machine exists
      community.vmware.vmware_guest_info:
        validate_certs: false 
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        username: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        password: "{{ vmware_password }}"
        datacenter: "ha-datacenter"
        name: "{{ vmware.name }}"
      delegate_to: localhost
      ignore_errors: true
      throttle: 1
      register: vmware_validate_guest
      when: destructive is not defined or not destructive</code></pre>



<p>The next block of code will set the <code>destructive</code> variable to true IF we did the validation check from the previous block.  The validation check in the previous block will not run if <code>destructive</code> is set to true.  This acts as a one-way gate.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - set_fact:
        destructive: yes
      when: |
        vmware_validate_guest is defined and (
          (vmware_validate_guest.skipped is defined and not vmware_validate_guest.skipped) 
          or (vmware_validate_guest.failed is defined and vmware_validate_guest.failed == True)
        )</code></pre>



<p>Things get a little bit tricky here, but I will explain the rationale behind this next block.  Your inventory file only has virtual machines defined in it, but for ansible remote connections to work properly, a host must be in inventory.  To get around this, in the middle of this playbook run, we call add_host which has an explicit delegate_to statement so that it runs on localhost.</p>



<p>The reason this is tricky is because of the way that ansible does variable expansion.  One would think that a single host is being added to the inventory, but what is really happening in a playbook?  Ansible is expanding variable scope out to each individual machine in the inventory.  This means that add_host is actually being added in the context of each host in the inventory.  If you have 10 hosts defined in inventory, add_host adds variables for your VMWare host for each inventory host.</p>



<p>TLDR; each host in inventory now has the ability to utilize a <code>delegate_to: {{ vmware_host }}</code> statement as part of their tasks.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Add vmware as a host
      add_host:
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        ansible_ssh_host: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        ansible_user: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        ansible_ssh_pass: "{{ vmware_password }}"
      when: destructive</code></pre>



<p>Next, we need to do a little bit of math.  This could be done live through future executions, but I like to split things like this out into separate set_fact tasks to ensure I can easily run any debug tasks in the future.</p>



<p>Basically, this accomplishes telling VMWare that I want my CPU cores evenly distributed across sockets.  This is not perfect because it does not take care of edge cases of 1 CPU or 3 CPUs being defined in inventory.  For my use cases, I never define anything that way, but this could easily be updated to accommodate.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - set_fact:
        num_cpu_cores_per_socket: "{{ vmware.num_cpus | int / 2 }}"</code></pre>



<p>Next, if we are destructive, we need to delete an existing VM.  I am not going to rehash any of the special variables from above.  The only relevant thing to notice here is the state being set to absent which will delete the machine, and force is set to true which will bypass any safety checks VMWare might do.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Remove virtual machine from inventory
      community.vmware.vmware_guest:
        validate_certs: false
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        username: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        password: "{{ vmware_password }}"
        name: "{{ vmware.name }}"
        state: absent
        force: True
      delegate_to: localhost
      throttle: 1
      when: destructive</code></pre>



<p>Next is a little bit of cleanliness.  The delete statement above will not actually cleanup the VMWare datastore filesystem.  We are performing a <code>delegate_to: {{ vmware_host }}</code> which means we will be running a direct delete over SSH to your server running vmware.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Delete VM Folders
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: "{{storage_path}}/{{ vmware.name }}/"
        state: absent
      delegate_to: "{{ vmware_host }}"
      when: destructive
      throttle: 5</code></pre>



<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<p>Finally, the meat of the playbook.  This task creates the VM which is defined in the inventory.  I will break down the relevant variables below.</p>



<ul><li>Folder is neccisary for vShpere.  When only running ESXi, this only requires a default value of /vm/.  Most home labs will not need to change this.</li><li>state is set to poweredoff.  You could set this to poweredon but leaving it poweredoff ensures you can do post-processing after this create task.</li></ul>



<p>Please note, <code>Create a virtual machine on vmware</code> is not referencing any kind of existing disk image.  This will create a new completely blank VM.  Subsequent tasks will utilize your disk image to ensure it is properly attached to this machine.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Create a virtual machine on vmware
      community.vmware.vmware_guest:
        validate_certs: false
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        username: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        password: "{{ vmware_password }}"
        folder: /vm/
        name: "{{ vmware.name }}"
        state: poweredoff
        guest_id: "{{ vmware.guest_id }}"    
        disk: "{{ vmware.disks }}"
        datastore: "{{ datastore_name }}"
        hardware:
          boot_firmware: efi
          memory_mb: "{{ vmware.memory_mb }}"
          num_cpus: "{{ vmware.num_cpus }}"
          num_cpu_cores_per_socket: "{{ num_cpu_cores_per_socket | int }}"
          scsi: paravirtual
        networks:
        - name: "{{ vmware.port_group }}"
          connect: yes
          mac: "{{ vmware.mac_address  }}"
          ip: "{{ vmware.ip_address }}"
          netmask: "{{ vmware.netmask }}"
          device_type: vmxnet3
          type: static
      delegate_to: localhost
      register: deploy_vm
      throttle: 5
      when: destructive</code></pre>



<p>Next, perform a copy of an existing disk image into the folder that was just created for this new virtual machine.  This will essentially perform the same action that vSphere performs when cloning templates.</p>



<p>The key here is to utilize <code>vmkfstools</code> over ssh to ensure that you are able to get a thin provisioned copied disk.  If this is performed directly via ansible modules, you are not able to get a thin disk without vSphere.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Copy boot disk VMDK Files
      ansible.builtin.command: "{{ item }}"
      delegate_to: "{{ vmware_host }}"
      loop:
        - vmkfstools -i "{{storage_path}}/{{ image_name }}/{{ image_name }}.vmdk" "{{storage_path}}/{{ vmware.name }}/{{ image_name }}.vmdk" -d thin
      when: destructive
      throttle: 3</code></pre>



<p>Next, we need to tell VMWare to mount our cloned disk to the recently created VM.  The new VM will have a scsi_controller so we just need to give it the right controller number of 0, and unit_number 1 to ensure we do not overwrite the new disk created via <code>Create a virtual machine on vmware</code>.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Add boot disks to virtual machine
      community.vmware.vmware_guest_disk:
        validate_certs: false
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        username: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        password: "{{ vmware_password }}"
        name: "{{ vmware.name }}"
        datacenter: ha-datacenter
        disk:
          - filename: "&#091;{{datastore_name}}] {{ vmware.name }}/{{ image_name }}.vmdk"
            scsi_type: 'paravirtual'
            scsi_controller: 0
            unit_number: 1
      delegate_to: localhost
      register: disk_facts
      when: destructive
      throttle: 5</code></pre>



<p>And finally we tell ESXi to power on the virtual machine.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>    - name: Power on virtual machine
      community.vmware.vmware_guest:
        validate_certs: false
        hostname: "{{ vmware_host }}"
        username: "{{ vmware_user }}"
        password: "{{ vmware_password }}"
        name: "{{ vmware.name }}"
        state: poweredon
        wait_for_ip_address: yes
      delegate_to: localhost
      register: deploy_vm
      when: destructive</code></pre>

<p>I was looking through Reddit today and saw an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/ycgtkg/convert_output_of_file_to_json_using_j2_template/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/ycgtkg/convert_output_of_file_to_json_using_j2_template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting question</a> about how to manipulate files with <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Ansible">Ansible</a>.  I took a few minutes to throw together <a href="https://github.com/gwagner/ansible-examples/tree/main/read-file-output-json" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/gwagner/ansible-examples/tree/main/read-file-output-json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an example </a>of how to convert a relatively simple file, a list of strings broken up by new lines, and output it as JSON.  </p>



<p>Doing file conversions or data munging is an important skill to learn when growing in a <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> position.  While this is a fairly basic example, utilize this as a stepping stone to understanding more complex data structures.</p>



<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7120242057450442"
     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h2>Simple Text to JSON Conversion with Ansible</h2>



<p>Below is the Ansible code to read in a file name input.txt delimited by newline characters and then do a simple conversion to JSON writing to output.json.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>- name: Simple Read file and output JSON
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local 
  become: false
  tasks:
  - name: Read Data File
    set_fact:
      data: "{{lookup('ansible.builtin.file', './input.txt').split('\n')}}"

  - name: Show debug data
    ansible.builtin.debug: var=data

  - name: Write output json file
    copy:
      dest: output.json
      content: "{{ data | to_json }}" </code></pre>



<h3>Task By Task Breakdown</h3>



<p>The first task reads the input.txt file into a data variable that Ansible can use. It also splits the file into a list via the \n (newline) character.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>  - name: Read Data File
    set_fact:
      data: "{{lookup('ansible.builtin.file', './input.txt').split('\n')}}"</code></pre>



<p>set_fact can be one of your best friends in Ansible. It allows you to take either data from what you have available in your playbook run, or lookup data and set it to a useable var for future tasks.  Here I am calling lookup to read an input.txt file and saving it to a data var.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>  - name: Show debug data
    ansible.builtin.debug: var=data</code></pre>



<p>ansible.builtin.debug lets you output the values of variables to the terminal during a playbook run.  This code should not be utilized anywhere except for testing.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>  - name: Write output json file
    copy:
      dest: output.json
      content: "{{ data | to_json }}" </code></pre>



<p>Finally, utilizing the built-in copy module, you can feed it a variable, like data, and then pipe that to a to_json jinja2 function which will then write your file out to dest.</p>



<p>The result of running this playbook will look something like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code json"><code>&#091;"/site/foo/", "/site/bar/"]</code></pre>



<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7120242057450442"
     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h2>Complex Text to JSON Conversion with Ansible</h2>



<p>Below is the Ansible code to read in a file name input.txt delimited by newline characters.  After reading the file, a new variable is initialized name data_elements.  A loop is then run to create new dictionary objects with a key of &#8216;name&#8217; and a value of each line of input.txt.  Finally, a copy is run to write the data to disk under output.json.  </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>- name: Complex Read file and output JSON
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local 
  become: false
  tasks:
  - name: Read Data File
    set_fact:
      data: "{{lookup('ansible.builtin.file', './input.txt').split('\n')}}"

  - name: Show debug data
    ansible.builtin.debug: var=data

  - name: Create a new array
    set_fact: 
      data_elements: &#091;]

  - name: Loop through lines and add data elements to array
    set_fact:
      data_elements: "{{ data_elements + &#091;{'name': item}] }}"
    loop: "{{ data }}"

  - name: Show debug data
    ansible.builtin.debug: var=data_elements

  - name: Write output json file
    copy:
      dest: output.json
      content: "{{ {'records': data_elements} | to_json }}" 
</code></pre>



<h3>Task By Task Breakdown</h3>



<p>Since most of the code here is the same, I will only focus on breaking out the differences.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code> - name: Create a new array
    set_fact: 
      data_elements: &#091;]</code></pre>



<p>The block above sets up the empty data_elements array that we will utilize to map our file lines onto.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>  - name: Loop through lines and add data elements to array
    set_fact:
      data_elements: "{{ data_elements + &#091;{'name': item}] }}"
    loop: "{{ data }}"</code></pre>



<p>This is setting up a loop to loop over our initial data variable which was read from input.txt.  It is appending new dictionaries into a larger array with a key of &#8216;name&#8217; and a value of the item in a loop.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code yaml"><code>  - name: Write output json file
    copy:
      dest: output.json
      content: "{{ {'records': data_elements} | to_json }}" </code></pre>



<p>Finally, we are doing the same write operation as the simple example, but this time we are creating a dictionary with a key of &#8216;records&#8217; and a value of the data_elements array.</p>



<p>This will have an output that looks like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code json"><code>{
   "records":&#091;
      {
         "name":"/site/foo/"
      },
      {
         "name":"/site/bar/"
      }
   ]
}</code></pre>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As I stated at the beginning of the article, data manipulation in DevOps is a key skill to learn.  Hopefully, this helps kickstart someone on their journey into becoming a DevOps engineer!.</p>

<p>Whether you are looking to make a shift in your career path, or you are looking to change companies a common question job seekers will have is &#8220;Are <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> Engineers in Demand?&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Simply looking at job boards and reviewing the numbers does not tell the entire story here. As of the time of writing LinkedIn has roughly 42,000 positions and Indeed has roughly 11,000 positions for the search term DevOps engineer.</strong></p>



<p>I believe that the honest answer to this question has more to do with market conditions than it does with job openings, though job openings are still a good indicator.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the market conditions to understand if a DevOps engineering skillset is in demand!</p>



<p>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

<h2>Rising Demand for DevOps Talent</h2>



<p>Many of us in the technology industry know how DevOps is revolutionizing software development. Companies adopting the DevOps approach are doing more with greater efficiency in the process. DevOps can help a company provide a software solution quickly. It can therefore help prevent production problems if necessary and the result will also be improved customer experience, feedback, and communications.</p>



<p>Through to pandemic, more and more businesses needed to move to a digital presence to stay competitive in the market. This either means investing more heavily in technology or standing up new technology they may not have been ready for.</p>



<p>As the dust has settled, businesses are now left with aging technology that is not growing with their business which means future investment. The tech industry is stepping up to respond in this newly opened market.</p>



<p>If a business is not purely technology focused but utilizes technologies to enable sales, they are going to want to get into the most reliable modes of future delivery. This is where DevOps skills are filling the gap.</p>



<p>I have seen a new term popping up in the industry recently: &#8220;DevOps As A Service&#8221;. This is born out of the idea that the DevOps methodology can be bolted onto technologies that are becoming more relevant in the market to ensure more reliable modes of delivery.</p>



<h2>Is DevOps still in Demand?</h2>



<p>I am a hiring manager running a DevOps group. I have been hiring, training, and converting people from either IT operations teams or software development teams for nearly a decade now. I can confidently say that DevOps engineering roles are hard to fill, they are also very in demand and you need to move quickly when hiring.</p>



<h2>DevOps Talent is Still Hard to Find</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the industry has done a terrible job of defining what DevOps really is. In most places, my experience has been, DevOps means infrastructure as code and does not account for the overall methodology.</p>



<p>Because of the incongruency between expectation and implementation, I would argue that a large portion of the talent pool is underdeveloped at this point. With the proper guidance, the talented job seekers out there can transition into a more DevOps-oriented mindset.</p>



<p>Businesses will need to take this into account when hiring for a DevOps engineer role. The perfect purple unicorn may not be as readily available as more well-defined roles like software engineering. With a little time and patience with a team committed to DevOps transformations, you can develop talent that will deliver high-quality work.</p>



<h2>Is it hard to get a job in DevOps?</h2>



<p>Many organizations do not know what DevOps actually means, so it&#8217;s challenging to find the right person for the position.</p>



<p>I updated my LinkedIn profile in 2015 to illustrate my transition into DevOps Engineering. Since then, I have progressed through an organization to lead teams of DevOps engineers.</p>



<p>I am not telling you this to brag, but I do want to use it as an example.</p>



<p>In my previous life, I was a PHP developer. I got bored of putting values into a database and then returning the exact same values to the screen. I started to get interested in configuration management and continuous integration which is when i hit the job market looking for my next gig.</p>



<p>Since 2015, when i changed by job title on LinkedIn, i still get recruiters reaching out looking to place me in another software engineering role.</p>



<p>I believe that the cycle of job searching in the technology industry is a bit upside down today. Companies seek talent and job seekers are looking for companies that want their skilled talent. It should be a perfect union, but there are a hoard of recruiters standing in the way of those perfect fits.</p>



<p>I would recommend spending your time learning about DevOps methodologies, optimizing value, soft skill, interpersonal skills, and automation tools. Form there, i would spend time looking up individuals with existing DevOps roles on LinkedIn (management or engineering) and make some connections. Those connections have a better chance of landing you a DevOps role than the normal recruiting mechanism most of the technology space uses today.</p>



<h2>Is DevOps Engineer a good career?</h2>



<p>DevOps is booming with an estimated US $287 billion market size by 2026. There are many roles available to developers in the world&#8217;s marketplace. Let&#8217;s face it, technology is not going away. Businesses that survive over the long haul are going to progressively adopt newer and more modern strategies to optimize their software development life cycle.</p>



<p>Because of the perpetual adoption of DevOps methodology by businesses, a DevOps engineer is going to have a long and vibrant career path. Silo&#8217;d development and operations teams will become more of an antiquated setup, and the merge of these disciplines together will become more of the norm.</p>



<p>I think the answer of &#8220;Good&#8221; is probably a bit more nebulous and needs a bit of personal soul-searching to really answer. I won&#8217;t be able to answer what is &#8220;Good&#8221; for you.</p>

<h2>Why DevOps is a Good Career in 2022?</h2>



<p>DevOps has remained a popular role since its inception in 2018. CodinGame released a survey that ranks &#8220;DevOps Engineer&#8221; among the most popular developer job positions for 2021. Additionally, the survey revealed that 43% of hiring professionals are unable to fulfill their DevOps roles.</p>



<h2>What are Relevant Skills to start a DevOps career?</h2>



<p>Unlike most careers, DevOps requires basic knowledge and skills. When choosing an employment option, understanding this section can prove very important. If you do this before, then the barriers will be lower. Depending on the skills you have you can try another course.</p>



<p>I have an entire write-up over here that discusses the <a href="https://www.valewood.org/top-relevant-devops-skills/" data-type="post" data-id="330">Top Relevant DevOps Skills</a>.</p>



<p>TLDR; Focus on skills that support the DevOps philosophy. These are going to be focused on soft skills such as planning and communication. Also focus on learning some new tools, ci/cd, how to enable automation, and automated testing.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid if you are lacking in any of these areas as well, most of the &#8220;DevOps pros&#8221; that i talk to are not familiar with half of the skills described in either the blog post or TLDR.</p>



<h2>How do I Progress in my DevOps Career?</h2>



<p>DevOps engineers with learning mindsets will be able to develop in their respective fields with plenty more to do. It seems obvious that one has to progress from junior engineering engineer to junior engineer eventually becoming a leader. DevOps also offers many career changes that could be made.</p>



<p>A simple way to think about progression is to focus on anything that helps drive a business forward through growth or hitting new targets. This means that, in general, new technologies will not progress your career path forward.</p>



<p>Building a DevOps mindset, working with a team to adopt DevOps, training new DevOps engineers, working with teams to develop software in a more streamlined way, bringing in automated testing, breaking down organizational silos, influencing team leaders, and any other non-technology-specific skill you can pick up will help progress your DevOps career.</p>



<p>Focusing on technologies will help progress from a DevOps engineer role into a DevOps architect role, but note that a pure technology focus does have an upper bound on it. That is not a bad thing because not everybody wants to get into management.</p>



<p>If you are looking to progress your career into management, work on building a DevOps culture.</p>



<h2>Will I get paid more as a DevOps Engineer?</h2>



<p>DevOps professionals are generally paid quite well. This is because the skillset for DevOps jobs demands a broader set of skilled talent. DevOps experts who can work with companies on DevOps transformations will yield an even greater salary. When negotiating, do not sell your talents and skills short.</p>



<p>If you are just diving into this space, also be realistic about where you are at and sell yourself on your aptitude and ability to learn new skills. Any organization worth sticking around and working for will recognize your growth and give you the bump in compensation that you deserve.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>DevOps is evolving and changing. It is growing in importance for businesses to move forward in the digital age. DevOps engineers are key players in this evolution and have a wide range of skills needed by companies to thrive in the modern economy. They can work within many different industries, from financial services to automotive. DevOps engineers typically work with software teams across multiple departments within organizations, including IT operations and engineering.</p>



<p>DevOps teams are constantly looking for more talent that can fulfill the vision of smoother and more reliable delivery. That trend is not going away any time soon!</p>

<p>This is a pretty loaded question.  Is cooking a skill?  Are home builders skilled or unskilled labor?  A skill would denote being able to do something well or having expertise in practice.  Skills can be trained!  Being in a field of skilled labor like running CNC equipment requires a tremendous amount of skill.</p>



<p>So, is <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="15" title="How To Leverage the DevOps Methodology for Success!​" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevOps</a> a skill or is it a logical evolution where technology delivery ends up going regardless of the forces that drive it there?</p>

<h2>Technology Delivery</h2>



<p>Delivering technology, with any kind of <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/benefits-of-devops/devops-culture-of-quality/" data-type="page" data-id="1036">quality</a> backing that delivery, will require several different practices.  Depending on your domain; you will probably employ the specialties of software developers, infrastructure/cloud engineers, quality assurance engineers, security engineers, and network engineers, along with a whole host of other roles.  Each of those roles is critical to the successful execution of a project at a very high standard.  </p>



<p>Once the technology is delivered to the market, someone is going to have to pick up the mantle and run that technology solution.  In some organizations that will be a dedicated operations team, and in others they will adhere to a &#8220;you build it you own it&#8221; strategy.</p>



<p>One of the biggest misnomers that I run across quite frequently is this; once a project is launched, the skilled labor that developed that project is no longer needed over the lifetime of that technology.  I believe that this could not be further from the truth.</p>



<h2>Technology Lifecycle > Delivery</h2>



<p>I prefer to look at technology through the lens of a lifecycle rather than a static point-in-time delivery.  Once a technology product is launched, it needs a tremendous amount of care and feeding to ensure that it remains valuable to its end users.  </p>



<p>Due to the complex nature of the domains that I generally work in, this means that the skilled labor that helped produce said technology product will continue to have a hand in that technology product for its entire lifecycle.  It does not mean that they will be entirely dedicated to a single effort, but it does mean they will continue to lend their expertise.</p>



<p>So, how does this answer the question &#8220;Is DevOps a skill?&#8221;.  For me, the answer is a simple one, YES!  But I think that it first takes an understanding of what <a href="https://www.valewood.org/topics/devops/" data-type="page" data-id="505">DevOps</a> is.</p>



<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>



<p>DevOps is a series of practices that combine together into a consistent delivery flow for technology.  It is generally misrepresented as purely automation, but that is only a particular skilled practice inside DevOps.  Embracing DevOps fully is a serious commitment to changing how technology delivery is performed, and full adoption means that you will be more interested in the overall lifecycle of technology instead of just finite delivery points in time.</p>



<h2>What Expertise is Needed for DevOps?</h2>



<p>I believe that most organizations are following a more traditional software delivery methodology.  They have not adopted DevOps or agile in any meaningful way, and if they have at the very least adopted agile they are not using a standardized framework.  This is not true everywhere, but I believe it is more true than false.</p>



<h3>Advocating for and Leading Change</h3>



<p>Since most organizations are building and deploying software with some degree of success in whatever way works for them, to build real DevOps adoption, a change agent is going to need to be bravely thrown into the mix to help drive the change they want to see in the world.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s face it, Change is hard.  Change brings the unknown right to our doorsteps and forces us to confront aspects of our work that may feel uncomfortable.  Depending on your level in an organization, either being an advocate for change or leading through change is a trainable skill that individuals should look into developing.</p>



<h3>Agile Project Management</h3>



<p>Project management is a pretty crowded space.  There are plenty of certifications out there that individuals can go get to skill up in this space as well.  But, agile project management is not just for project managers, everyone should become well versed in this space.</p>



<p>Learning about risks and risk management, work breakdown structures, timelines, forecasting, Gantt charts, resource management, and all of the rest of the highly skilled practices in agile project management will only enhance a DevOps team&#8217;s ability to deliver effective and high-quality solutions.  If a project manager is left to fully manage a project independently while engineers are heads down in code and poorly communicating, that project is doomed for failure from the very beginning.</p>

     data-ad-slot="6094810801"></ins>
	<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
</p>



<h3>Transforming Communication</h3>



<p>In order to adopt effective DevOps practices, a team will need to build effective communication patterns.  </p>



<p>Some organizations will adopt a pattern of tickets first.  &#8220;If it isn&#8217;t in the ticket, it didn&#8217;t happen&#8221;.  This is a great asynchronous communication pattern that ensures that communication is available more broadly to any consumers that may have questions or need updates.  It is an ineffective communication pattern if nobody ever reads the tickets.</p>



<p>Other organizations will adopt in-person or remote scrums to talk about what they worked on, will be working on, and challenges.  This can be a really good communication pattern for individuals who like to talk through and collaborate on problems.  This is a terrible pattern when it comes to groups that are spread a little too thin or have a WIP problem.</p>



<p>Communication must work for the individuals who are producing communication and consuming communication.  I have seen multiple different scenarios fail because members of the team are not willing to adapt to each other and ensure success.  There are a tremendous number of tools on the market, I am confident that any team willing to put in the work to find the right one can become effective communicators.</p>



<h3>Effective Feedback Loops</h3>



<p>Along with communication, feedback loops are also incredibly important to a DevOps team.  If automated testing fails, where do notifications go?  If there is a problem with production, where does communication go?  If these two events, or many other different kinds of events, impact delivery; where does that communication go?</p>



<p>By ensuring that feedback is making its way back to the proper parties, more effective data-driven decision-making can happen.  Without feedback loops from tools, systems, or people; we are all left guessing!</p>



<h3>Tools Tools Tools</h3>



<p>10 years ago, the market for DevOps tools (technology tools) was pretty sparse.  You were left with bash scripts on Linux servers, limited API access, and using your legs to walk down to your local data center to pop in the newest RedHat CD.</p>



<p>Today, the number of tools in the DevOps space is expansive.  I am not going to go too deep into the tooling here because of its depth, but any DevOps team worth its weight will need to have some serious skills with the latest DevOps tools.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wrote this post to answer the question, &#8220;Is DevOps a skill?&#8221;.  I believe that the answer to that question is a resounding yes.  It is as much of a skill as sculpting clay into a piece of art or customizing a classic car.  There is a high degree of depth in expertise for a DevOps team to be effective in their delivery processes.  Finally, any organization out there that thinks they are doing DevOps without these skills is not fully realizing the benefits that DevOps has to offer.</p>
